1,"The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way."
2,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.

Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.

Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.

Film of the year? Nope."
3,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
4,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.

Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.

It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.

Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).

I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."
5,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it."
6,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director"
7,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.

this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
8,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
10,"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting. To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience."
11,"The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.

I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.

Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like ""HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!"", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the ""Don't smile"" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.

Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told ""sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?"", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$"
12,"I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.

I watched it and was bored. the aesthetics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performance of the joker was a good performance but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many.

this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was actually thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.

I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.

Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, joker did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.

I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGG

This movie is bang average and way overhyped.

phoenix performance is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrum of performance he could have with the character.

I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.

there is a real world out there."
14,"While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike, they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film."
15,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
16,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
17,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
20,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point."
21,"The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh."
22,"What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a ""masterpiece"" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy."
23,"The reviews here are making this film out to be far better than it actually is. Don't get me wrong, technically, it is extremely well done and Phoenix's performance is really quite extraordinary (he is definitely looking at an Oscar nomination), but despite excellent writing, acting and direction....

....the film is kinda boring.

It had its moments, and, sure, it has some very disturbing elements but....If I had a watch, I would have looked at it many times as what this film lacks is...excitement.

The final act is most excellent, but it felt like it took forever to get to it."
24,"They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli. This is lazy writing, focused more on fancy long shots of Joaquin Phoenix dancing crazily than producing something of value to the franchise."
25,"This is just my opinion but I loved the Joker, the performances, cinematography, directing, style, all build a great story. And the acting from Phoenix was incredible, he done a great take for the iconic character, and wow does he commit, with loosing the weight for the role, to developing the laugh."
26,"The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity"" & Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime. Choreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking. The cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10. Edit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!."
27,"This is not an underdog antihero story, if that's what you were expecting. This movie makes no attempt (as so many other movies do these days) to put a positive spin on a villain or invert morality to make its protagonist secretly good or make the audience root for him. Despite this, the film elicits empathy for the broken man it holds in its spotlight in the same way one might feel empathy for a diseased, mistreated, but ultimately unsalvageable dog. In the end, your heart goes out to him, but you still feel like someone should put him down, and that's exactly how one ought to feel for one of Gotham's most well known psychopaths."
28,"The origins of a Monster.

If you see one film this year, please see The Joker. It does seem that we are getting constant remakes and origins films, but this is remarkable, I think people are fed up of both mentioned categories because many of the movies we're presented with haven't come up to scratch. The Joker however is phenomenal, the best film I've seen in the cinema for quite some time. I was enthralled from start to finish. The story is fantastic, the writing thoughtful and intelligent.

Joaquin Phoenix, what can you say, it's a master class performance from him, he injects everything needed into the part, to make it chilling, sad and menacing. No wonder the awards are flowing.

I genuinely cannot remember the last time I left a cinema feeling so rewarded by a film.

Incredible. 10/10"
30,I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.
31,"In Gotham City, the clown and aspirant comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is an outcast mentally disturbed man that lives with his deranged mother Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy). When the social service office that attends him is shutdown, Arthur stops his medication and the abusive society drives him crazier to a criminal life.

""Joker"" is a dark and depressive film that discloses a dramatic version of the Joker´s origin. Joaquin Phoenix has a top-notch performance in the role of a mentally disturbed man disregarded by the society with a nervous twitch. His acting makes the viewer recalls and compares with Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Knight"", the best so far. The dark and gruesome cinematography shows a dirty Gotham City with the garbage collector strike. The music score is also spectacular with hits from the 70´s and 80´s. My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): ""Coringa"" (""Joker"")"
32,"This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.

If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you."
34,"Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.

I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.

Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing"
35,"Right, with all the praise and hype that the 2019 movie ""Joker"" from director Todd Phillips have been getting, this is very much a movie that you'd eventually find your way to watching.

I did so too, and let me just say that expectations were high when I sat down to watch ""Joker"". Expectations that the movie didn't live up to. Man, this movie was definitely not my cup of tea.

First of all, the pacing of the movie. Talk about being prolonged and dragging on, without nothing much of any real worth happening. Sure Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his acting performance as Arthur Fleck and the gradual downward sloping trip towards becoming the Joker.

But the storyline wasn't really one that did much to get me worked up. Director Todd Phillips took quite his time to get from A to B, and without dishing out much in terms of phenomenal storytelling and movie presentation along the way.

There was one scene, a single scene, that was glorious, and it was when Arthur Fleck was on the Murray Franklin show and what happened to Murray Franklin on live TV. That scene actually had me laughing. But the rest of the movie was somewhat of a slow-paced drag to sit through. Sure, it was somewhat entertaining, but awfully slow paced. However, this is hardly a movie that I will be watching a second time around.

Aside from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, the movie also bolstered performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy, whom individually were adding something good to the movie, just a shame that they didn't have more screen time.

I don't understand why critics are so worked up about this movie, I honestly don't. It wasn't all that particularly outstanding or entertaining. Sure, it is a movie about an iconic villain in the DC universe, but that is about as far as it goes.

I am rating this overhyped and overrated movie a less than mediocre four out of ten stars."
36,"Gotham is in dire difficulties like New York City back in the 70's. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally unstable clown. He laughs uncontrollably in stressful times. He gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths. He gets fired from his job. He lives with his unstable sick mom (Frances Conroy) who worked for Thomas Wayne and claims him to be her ex-lover and Arthur's biological father. When Arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway, he shoots them dead. Thomas Wayne is outraged by the killing of these three well-educated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayor's office. Arthur has a relationship with his single-mom neighbor Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) and admires talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).

This is great character work from Joaquin Phoenix. He is one of the great actors working today. Director Todd Phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise. I do have a couple of problems with his work. The smaller problem is the continuous shooting of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne with her pearls. That scene has been done so many times in the past three decades. It may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun. Don't show the shooting. Just do the sound of the shot and leave. It's all been done before and Phillips should know this. The bigger issue is setting up this world. I think Phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given. The streets have lots of garbage. There are news reports. Phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie. It needs a Wall Street protest or two. At least, there should be a protest in front of Wayne Tower. The first clown protest against Wayne seems to come out of nowhere. The hatred of the rich needs some background. Overall, this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on."
38,"Writer-director Todd Phillips's new movie ""Joker"" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist's prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses."
40,"Dark, depressing and unsettling film with a haunting score. Incredible acting, directing and screenplay. Joaquin killed it. 5 out of 5 stars! Mental health is so important guys!!!"
41,"This movie is a masterpiece! It absolutely epitomizes what a DC movie should be. Dark, emotional, thought provoking, not just action action action. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.

Critics have definitely lost touch with the public and should be ignored on this one. Do yourself a favor and watch it!

And remember to be good to one another. You dont know what someone else is going through."
44,"In many aspects, it is a mirror. For society, for viewer, for the way of development of society. Its basic virtues - the splendid performance of Joaquin Phoenix and the beautiful cinematography. And, sure, the ignore of comic book character for feel the film not as portrait but as large cry. The sins - maybe too much ""Taxi Driver"" and the ambition to explain and show everything. The angry, the frustrations, the refuges, the falls of mind and soul are only suggested for be, in real sense, credible. Short, a form of manifesto. Or only a sort of mirror for each of its viewers."
45,"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, and in an endless sea of mediocre cape flicks released every year, the Joker obviously looks like a masterpiece by comparison.

The movie itself is not as memorable or clever as the fanboys claim it is, but it still mesmerizes me the passionate reactions everyone seems to have about the Joker, with some acting as if this was some sort of cinematic Antichrist (Similar to the way in which a lot of people reacted to the mere existence of movies like the Da Vinci Code or the Last Temptation of the Christ back then) claiming it would definitely inspire acts of violence.

I can't help but find ironic how a movie that demonizes the rich (To be fair, they totally deserve to be demonized) still manages to get lot of love from the same kind of reactionaries that would be against billionaires paying higher taxes, and also a lot of love from people who worship Trump as a god (Despite the fact that Trump and his cronies are very close in personality to the trio of rich jerks that harass Arthur in the subway than Thomas Wayne-Who, by the way, isn't exactly portrayed very sympathetically either)

Must be a consequence of these clueless reviews and hot takes made by equally clueless reviewers that only focus in the fact that the main character is Caucasian and male, and not in the fact that he is poor and suffering from bad (physical and mental) health, despite the fact the movie clearly shows he is anything but privileged. And also, despite the fact the events from this movie are told from the perspective of Arthur Fleck, that doesn't mean the movie ""glorifies"" his behavior, nor is he portrayed as a hero (Also remember that plenty of scenes made very clear he is pretty delusional, so his perspective of the events is ambiguous at best, but it seems that modern audiences have become allergic to any form of ambiguity for some reason)

Sometimes I wonder why the Batman-related media seems to have such bizarre effect on people. It's the Dark Knight all over again, a decent movie treated as the best thing since sliced bread. And while I admit that while this is better than anything from the MCU, I also think that kind of soulless corporate garbage shouldn't be the measure of quality for anything."
47,"Mental health issues are a problem in our society. Or how they are viewed upon and how they are handled. The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We're talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I'd see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.

But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.

Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a ""thrill park ride"". Now that doesn't mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this. Then again, this is not even near the DCU ... don't compare this to something other (be it comic books or like a friend to Parasite, another favorite of mine of 2019) - enjoy it for what it is! A great movie"
48,"DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!

Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.

Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.

My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.

Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.

Score : 10/10

50,"Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is ""the rise of the Joker!"" 10/10"
51,"While we were at one of the only pre-screenings in my city, it has taken me a while to review this title, because I've been torn on it.

Yes, Joaquin Phoenix, who has always been a veritable bastion of talent, was masterful in the role. Yes, Phoenix's portrayal of his character was riveting. Yes, the story was both gripping and also necessary, especially today when it seems that mental illness is running rampant. Yes, the tone was magnificently set within both the cinematic and art direction.

What I have a problem with, is the way it tied into the Batman universe and particularly with what it had in common and what differentiated it from the Jokers of the past. I still have problems making the two worlds merge."
53,"This film surpassed all other films in portraying the slow descent into madness, caused by biological, psychological, social and familial factors. It also highlighted the decaying n broken system n society's austerity. The film is very dark, it has amazing cinematography n this year's best performance by Phoenix. It has a very surrealistic feel n in fact a solid non horror film which is terrifying n poignant."
54,"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh."
55,"Take the next ingredients :
The King of Comedy
Requiem for a Dream
The Dark Knight
Taxi Driver
Mix all of these and then ladys and gentlemans we have : Joker ."
56,Everyone should riot and be violent? The actor's skill isn't that great. Just laugh. Anyone can do that. Joker nominated for Academy award is a joke.
58,Creative actor Joaquin creativity embodied the role of the Joker film deserves more than 10
59,"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.

PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home."
60,"Good movie from Hollywood finally!

Good acting, predictable but good twists.

Building up great story.

However soke characters are flat.

Crowd scenes are silly (they still font have a good crowd director, background artists just hanging around aimlessly out of character and without any sense)

Music is too loud as usual.

Sounds too loud.

Special effects too much.

But nice music choice.

Luckily not too many much special effects and sounds used

Great work from the director, nice cut, good screenplay, good visual art.

I wish to see the next part with same style.

Wish to see batman and all the other characters but in this watchable style.

I would even put less action in them.

I wish to see batman, and all other twisted characters in real deep drama.

I hop to see more good movies like this."
61,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong. I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie. What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!"
62,"Joker is literally an achievement in cinematic history there's no doubt in that ! But why people comparing it with Endgame ? Both movies have their own ways and they are completely different. Endgame was the best at its genre. Talking about Joker ... What can I say ... A beautiful presentation of storyline , direction , screenplay was all at its peak of greatness ... Heath ledger smiling down to earth :)"
63,"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time"
64,"Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.

The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as ""The Hangover"" franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.

Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.

Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, ""I have nothing but bad thoughts"", we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.

Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any ""real"" Batman references.

Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for ""Chernobyl"") serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", Jimmy Durante singing ""Smile"", Cream's ""White Room"", ""That's Life"" by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar ""Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2"". The ""Smile"" song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).

The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind."
65,"Joaquin Phoenix produces one of the most memorable performances ever captured in a feature film, earning the hardware and accolades he received for his stunning and disturbing portayal of Joker.

Joaquin puts on a virtuoso spotlight performance, and elevates the movie to legendary status. Credit director Todd Philips for building tension throughout the film, capturing the nuances of Joker's tortured dark-side slide into deranged, violent insanity, keeping the film's pace and flow on-track without unnecessary fill, utilizing and applying various camera lenses, shot angles, lighting, colors/hues, aperture settings (e.g. bokeh), and scene framing, and allowing Joaquin to tap into his own dark corners and utilize his unique acting instincts in developing his character.

Phoenix's acting performance leaves nothing on the table - if keeping score, Phoenix tallies a perfect 10 producing a truly legendary performance, transforming the film from God knows what it would have been with another actor to a 9/10.

A performance and film that one will not easily forget."
67,It was a really slow paced and boring. It was too overhyped in my opinion.
68,"What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right."
69,"Whether you end up loving or hating Joker, Todd Phillip's gritty and Scorsese like take on the legendary DC comics villain, there's no denying that the cinematic comic book adaptations landscape has been changed forever.

Just as Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight trilogy, Joker's examination of the birth of a nefarious villain hellbent on chaos and anarchy is unlike anything we've ever seen before, stripping the well known character back to the bare basics as we're introduced to the sad life of the misunderstood and unloved Arthur Fleck.

Sharing more in common with dramas such as Taxi Driver and Serpico, rather than it's other comic book cousins, Phillip's and his mindbogglingly good leading man Joaquin Phoenix take us into the mind of a broken man trying to fit into a world that doesn't want to open its arms to him, in what's an engaging, cant look away character study that slowly but surely descends into a dark and uncomfortable place that befits the name and reputation of its title being.

It may seem far to early to call but I for one am confident in saying that Phoenix's full embodiment of Fleck goes down as one of the most singularly impressive acting turns of not only the decade, but all time.

Similar to what De Niro did as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, what Daniel Day Lewis did as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and what Pacino achieved with Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Phoenix commands every second of screen time he gets in Phillips dark tale, in what must surely be the biggest sure fire bet for an Oscar you could ever hope to get.

From the way in which Fleck appears physically, from a simple walk, through to a slight facial tick, right through to a haunting and hard to forget collection of haunting laughs, Phoenix appears in virtually every scene of Joker and never ones fails to enthrall, and in doing so his managed to do the seemingly impossible of allowing us to understand a deeply flawed and depraved creature but a creature you begin to understand and at times even feel sympathy towards.

For all the great incarnations of the character, it's hard to think of a better way in which the Joker could be born into existence and by bringing his own flavour and nuances to Fleck, there's no point in comparing Phoenix to Heath Ledger's iconic take on the face painted mad man, with this take a whole different beast entirely.

As good as Phoenix is, it would've only taken the film so far had Phillip's and his team not come to the party but for a relatively small budgeted film, Joker's astounding overall quality ensures it can comfortably sit in the top class of 2019 films.

It's amazing to think that this is a film from the same man that gave us Old School and The Hangover but Joker sees Phillip's grow into a whole new level with his on point direction, that fits perfectly with Lawrence Sher's eye-capturing 70's like cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir's memorizing score, giving Joker an epic and unforgettable cinematic verve that brings it's A game too match its captivating leading man.

While first and foremost a believable tale of a man pushed to the edge of his already teetering limits, Joker also manages to throw in a number of surprising narrative and comic book throwbacks that will be no doubt be discussed ad-nauseam by die-hard fans and naturally tie together Fleck's story to a much broader universe without ever feeling forced or unnatural, all within a tale that is as confronting and even topical as you'd get regardless of genre.

Final Say -

Bleak, beautiful and boundlessly inventive, led by a Joaquin Phoenix performance for the ages, Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.

70,"Best ever performance by JOAQUIN PHONEIX.

Sadness, Loneliness, Depression, Reality,People,Life can change a person pushing him to his limits breaking him and making him a worse and put him in a never ending loop.

I did not watch this as a villian portrayal but with a perspective of a man changing and doing what he wants most to escape loneliness.

In the movie he turns evil and punish others but it is not the way. Everyone deserves love and respect. Nobody knows what someone is going through in their life and we never know when will our disrespect will trigger something in them.

But as for a movie it is absolute perfection as homelander says ""It was perfect.even to the tiniest bit."""
71,What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it.
72,"Arthur(Phoenix, Oscar-worthy yet again) is a clown for hire. He wants to cheer up the world. And to experience human connection. For someone to notice him without becoming verbally, frequently even physically, abusive. To be treated like a person. He struggles with mental illness. Both finding successful treatment, and for others to stop responding so negatively to his diagnosis. And while he feels perpetually lonely, he's not the only one to realize how bad things are getting, and how little those with money and influence do to help anyone but themselves.

This is deeply messed up. It makes your mind go places you never thought it would. Including, maybe especially, when funny. In other words, it nails the core, managing to also put a fresh coat of paint on an icon with nearly 80 years of history. This explores how little sympathy and empathy(the lead only loses the audience's once he becomes a monster) is shown towards the least powerful people in society. However, it's not exclusively(albeit chiefly) about those with psychological issues. It also goes into poverty. How little those that could easily address these things even try to properly comprehend the problems. I'm not saying there's a solution that would not require time, political will and accountability for those who use their clout to try to fight these efforts. What I am saying is that we need those I'm talking about to join in the process.

Taxi Driver very clearly shaped a lot of this, to incredible effect, and this film is as amazing as that one. This is the first live-action version(at least in the last 30+ years, I will grant that I am not very familiar with the takes that go back further than that) where you can understand how the Joker ends up with his signature look in a realistic world. A vigilante using martial arts and gadgets would have felt hugely out of place in this, so I'm thrilled nothing like that appears(Bruce is a child here), and I hope that this remains standalone, rather than Joaquin facing off against Batman. Keeping in mind that I love The Dark Knight trilogy.

I rarely give anything the highest possible score. To me, it means that while the movie isn't perfect(that is a status that should be strived for: it can never truly be reached), there is no weakness within it that is not greatly outweighed by its positives. That's not even a contest when it comes to this. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who worked on this for being able to say that about it.

There is some bloody violence in this, a little of it immensely brutal. I recommend this to everyone who is passionate about the titular character. 10/10"
73,"If you have been avoiding the movie Joker (2019) because you think it belongs to the superhero genre and the violent world of masked crusaders then you are making a mistake. Just like I did. Set aside preconceptions and see what is one of the most powerfully introspective portraits of mental illness you will ever find on film - and Batman is nowhere to be seen.

Set in Gotham City in the recent pre-digital age, the story opens with Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling to live a normal life, hold a job, and care for his ageing mother. Abused as a child, he relies on medication for his cocktail of mental disorders, the most prominent of which is a condition where anxiety can trigger bursts of hysterical laughter (Pseudobulbar Affect). City Hall cuts back on support services and Arthur's untreated conditions escalate as he becomes more vulnerable to abuse, loses his job, and his dream of becoming a stand-up comic is cruelly exploited. With nothing to gain or lose, all that is left is vengeance. This plotline is merely a narrative framework for what is a phenomenal performance by Phoenix. His chiselled features, balletic body language, and elastic facial contortions have extraordinary power to express disconnectedness from the material world. As he endures the torments of an uncaring society, we become immersed in his value system where violence makes perfect sense.

The film was always going to generate controversy for its depiction of violence. However, it remains on the 'art' side of gratuitous and is more restrained than so many other violent but non-controversial films. The soundtrack and cinematography are edgy, and the camerawork is often so close to Arthur you can see the pores of his skin sweating fury at those around him. The film is visually engrossing: the sets ooze gothic decay, dystopian chaos, and streets full of vagrants and the dispossessed. The film's two-hour running time feels like one.

Phoenix single-handedly drives this film and he deserves critical acclaim. It was risky to bypass the usual magical fantasy of super-heroes and super-villians and take a serious look at a serious issue. Entertainment can be a powerful platform for education. While the script retains the tropes of Marvel Comics, it shows insight into mental illness with lines like ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? What you deserve""."
74,"It was well played film. Of course JF does his due diligence. However, people blew this up because thats all people do these days is talk about everything thats not real life. Was a good different spin on a DC comic movie. This was more of if Joker was though of outside of the DC world. I think since movie imagination and creativity has bern lost through cgi , we take a movie such as this and make a huge deal of it. So ehhh it was good but Stop with the hype."
75,"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.

Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.

When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?

Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!"
77,"In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.

Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.

The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.

Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.

In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized ""woke"" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.

But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. I wouldn't recommend it."
78,"You will notice the far left journalists: the New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Guardian and the rest all despised ""Joker."" They made up different prevarications such as no fun, meaningless, nihilistic, dangerously provocative and on and on. The real reason they had to gang up on this film and Phillipps is that we are seeing this fantasy become reality in America.

The far left run cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago and others look like Gotham. They are literally overflowing with filth, drug addicts, mental patients roaming free and bureaucrats running and enjoying it all. The are supported by hypocritical filmmakers with loads of money, politicians, and business leaders.

Phillipps is famous for non-PC, in-your-face comedy: rude, crude and breakout funny. But he cannot make films like that anymore. No one can. The far left speech police are violent, hate-filled, arrogant and stupendously self-righteous. Joker is the far left dystopia that is our future, coming soon to a neighborhood near you. They want the border eliminated, jails opened, locks broken and the rights of middle class citizens taken to allow mass bedlam.

They want the hard working, value driven bedrocks of society mutilated, defeated and destroyed in the ensuing melee. That has been their dream as under-realized by Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler and modern socialists.

This is a great film. It is a monumental film. It is not a comedy, it is a horror film. It is the kind of horror film few people pay to see: psychological horror and terror. Then why has it already made more than a billion dollars? Because there are so many people cheering for this very outcome. Others see it for it's greatest value: a look at the future."
79,"It's been a long time since I've been as unsettled by a movie as I was by ""Joker."" The last one I can think of that comes close was ""First Reformed"" from last year, another film that taps into some very dark and disturbing feelings about the state of our modern world. But that movie at least offered the possibility of hope if you were willing to interpret it a certain way, whereas ""Joker"" is about as damn near nihilistic as you can get.

I didn't really even want to see this movie, because I'm sick to death of the whole superhero craze and our country's obsession with it. The Joker is one of the most overexposed of all villains, and I didn't give a rat's ass about his origin story. But the thing is, this is barely a movie about the Batman Joker. It's pretty clear that director Todd Phillips and actor Joaquin Phoenix can barely muster up the energy to tie this story into any greater mythology, and the few meager attempts to do so are the only times during the movie when my brain hit snooze and my attention drifted. The rest of the film is a deeply disturbing character study of a lone man who's so tired of trying to play by the rules of a system that has no place for him that he decides to make his own. I won't call Phoenix a revelation, because we all knew he could act, but holy cow does he do something special in this movie. This is Daniel Day-Lewis in ""There Will Be Blood"" territory we're talking about here, where the word ""acting"" seems inadequate to describe what's happening on screen.

There's a lot of controversy swirling around ""Joker."" Is it irresponsible to make a movie that basically gives lonely, angry white men a justification to carry out violent acts? Is the film just an empty, soulless, and cynical attempt to cash in on people's love of Batman and the series' villains? Is the film just ripping off of other, better movies, like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy?"" I think people will see what they want to see in ""Joker."" Some will see a hero figure in Arthur Fleck, and will either love or hate the movie because of it. Some will think the film is deep and profound while others will think it has nothing to say. I personally don't know that the film has anything to say, but the history of movies is full of great films that haven't necessarily ""said"" anything. ""Joker"" is a reaction to our very troubled times, and I was able to empathize with the character of Arthur Fleck to a certain point without condoning all of his actions. He's a mentally ill man who wants to get help but doesn't know how, or who's the victim of a system that doesn't care about mentally ill people. Meanwhile, the system is run by a bunch of fat cats who only care about making themselves and their cronies richer, while life for the average American gets harder and harder. Toss in our country's obsession with violence in general and guns in particular, and people like Arthur Fleck will be the inevitable result. I didn't interpret the movie as a rallying cry for incels, and I don't think it glamorized violence at all. Leave it to the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies (just as one example) to do that, yet no one ever holds movies like that to task. But I do think that more people than not may find someone to relate to in Arthur Fleck, and maybe that's what's so unsettling. Like him, and like Howard Beale, another famous movie character who's fed up with the system, I'm mad as hell, and I don't want to take it anymore. Of course I will, because I'm a rational adult who understands that progressive change moves forward in fits and starts. But wouldn't it feel just a little bit good to say screw it all and burn down the whole mess?

It will be interesting to see how my reactions to ""Joker"" change over time and after we've passed this specific cultural moment. Who knows, maybe I'll think it's silly and juvenile twenty years from now when I think back on the Best Actor Oscar Joaquin Phoenix is almost certain to win. But right now, there's not a movie I've seen recently that feels more relevant or urgent than this one, and the balls this film has makes everything else currently playing look like a made-for-T.V. movie by comparison.

Grade: A"
80,"The highlights of this film are the gritty retro style and the acting. This film is a very serious take on a comic book character that attempts to make him more grounded, like a human being and not a legend. Joaquin Phoenix totally deserved the Academy Award he got for his performance in this film. However, it's no masterpiece. How many different tragedies can happen to someone in a week? That felt really artificial, as if the filmmakers had a checklist of tragic events and felt obligated to cram in every single one somewhere."
81,"Without a doubt, Joker is in contention for the film of the year.

With Joachin Phoenix garnering praise left and right for Joker it's easy to dismiss the multiple other elements of direction, sound mixing, editing, cinematography, set and costume design and casting that make this a truly astounding piece of artistic cinema. Joker is a film that without any one of these elements, it would fail. It would slip into the same bracket as Suicide Squad and be forgotten, but, fail it certainly does not.

Joachin Phoenix is phenomenal. We know this already from pictures like Her and The Master, what we didn't know was how utterly deep and broad his range was. At points, I was totally absorbed by Joker. For the first time in possibly 10 years the movie theatre melted away, along with other viewers and noises and I was a part of that film. It was as if I was watching a documentary, rather than a fictional work. His commitment to the role, his weight loss and mental strain are dangerous but it produces something that no one ever thought would happen. It produces a performance that could genuinely rival Heath Ledgers.

Todd Phillips direction and script are masterstrokes. If it were a painting it would be a Turner, with bright violent skies, and dark sad landscapes. His beautiful melting pot of inspiration features large doses of Martin Scorsese's 'The King of Comedy' and 'Taxi Driver', alongside the physiological battery acid from more recent pictures such as Fight Club and Black Swan. It swirls together to birth this bitter, gritty, dark, mesmerising masterpiece, that both requires and demands, multiple, in-depth viewings.

For me, what makes this film is the costume design and the cinematography. The design of every minute detail on each character to make Gotham look even more drab and dull, even more grimy and beaten down is exceptional. Similar to how Scorsese made Harlem and The Bronx look broken and corrupted in Taxi Driver, you feel physically dirty after watching numerous sequences and you feel pangs of genuine social guilt stemming from your own moments of awful selfishness. The cinematography is astounding, and MUST be in contention for an Academy Award, alongside Best Lead, Best Direction and best Sound Mixing. Some of the shots could have been lifted from a Time Magazine piece on 'City Life' they're that artistically powerful. Whole, dialogue-free sequences that say far more with silence and sounds of a city teetering on the brink of oblivion in the background than anyone could ever say. The sound mixing to have conversations, telephones, car horns, shouting, trains prevalent in the background audio leaking into the foreground does what Nolan did in 'Dunkirk' and pushes further the feeling of strain. The idea that even noise is seeping in from the city and soon the barricade will break and it'll drown us all in it's filth, corruption and decadence.

Joker is a true masterpiece. So dark, so dirty, so vindictive of a modern flawed and broken societal system, but it always reminds you: Put on a happy face."
82,"In the film, we follow Arthur Fleck, a lonely and tortured guy who lives with his mom. A mentally unstable person, Arthur Fleck turns into a destructive force after several life blows and several humiliations and betrayals.

His transformation from a somewhat timid loner takes place gradually and we see his turning to the dark side of his personality. His transformation will affect everyone around him and along the way he will discover some uncomfortable things about himself.

Joaquin Phoenix's acting performance is remarkable, we don't see him alone in the film at all but truly as if he has disappeared as a person and Arthur Fleck has taken his place. Brilliant acting performance.

The film is superbly directed, each scene is carefully framed and guides us through the story. The cinematography is in harmony with the story and the atmosphere, it is carefully constructed and gives the film a look of hopelessness.

The pace of the story is perfect, everything makes sense and each event leads to a new phase of madness. We almost cheer for him in that madness of his and even sympathize with him at times as he continues his journey in this story of rage and violence.

Every detail contributes to the story and atmosphere, everything has its place in the film, every character makes sense and fits the story perfectly. The soundtrack is great, the music fits perfectly into the story, gives the film extra intensity and makes it even more impressive.

Truly an extraordinary film achievement."
84,"While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""

Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.

However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.

This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance."
85,"My God, this film is freaking amazing, and Phoenix gives the best performance ever. Think of Heath, a genius that deserved the Oscar, go the other way. Polar opposite interpretations. But both flawless and deserving of awards. See this film. If Phoenix does not get the Oscar, I will riot. Amazing."
86,"No one will ever say Joachin Phoenix didn't give his all, but if you watch enough loner-with-an-agenda film such as ""King Of Comedy"" or ""Taxi Driver"" you know where the pieces will fit. The other thing is that the message of how society, in its neglect for the mentally ill will cause a rift in a population that is sick and tired of being sick and tired. In this case, where you identify with is where the Joker can get you. And empathize for what he must do. An achievement in making the unintentional sociopath that we see in all the movies. It's not without its charm. Granted, these dark misanthrope characters never bothered me...call me a dark person...there are sly nods at what is to be (a young Bruce Wayne sliding down a playset pole to greet Fleck was an especially nice one). The other thing is what is known as anachronistic music and movies. Okay...having Cream and Gary Glitter and having Charlie Chaplin is no longer an alternate universe. It means Gotham is real and it kept having to readjust my mind that it wasn't New York City circa 1981. They either know our pop culture evolution or you don't. The other thing...is that it still raises so many questions as to the Joker's history. A simple one of emotional betrayal by those he held close but can't exhibit closeness isn't going to work. The betrayal is meaningless. Which, unfortunately, is the ugliness of The Joker. Who do you root for here. Thomas Wayne, the future tyrant capitalist, unwavering in a modicum of kindness who is a victim of rampant unrest between the rich and poor. Or the Joker, a product of the most sludge scraping bottom who does very little to further his lot in life other than to report to a menial job while being medicated to death? It's all ugly and there are no sunshine. That is NYC today...I mean Gotham. It's a perverse film that sets up larger ideas that seem to fizzle into an unnecessary overbearing notes of ""gee, isnt the music so different than what we see"" territory. Todd Phillips does an excellent job at capturing the time but look...it's either reality or it's not."
87,"Don't fall for it this movie is totally overhyped, borders between boring and irritating. Joaquin is good but the movie has no story and goes on aimlessly. Joaquin's behavior and crazy laughter is so repetitious. Who wrote those 10 star reviews?? Maybe family and friends of the people that worked on the movie??????"
88,"The masterpiece behind Joker is multifaceted, which is exactly why it is a masterpiece. It has flawless acting, perfect directing and real, gritty revelations of real life. If anyone thinks this movie is bad because it suggests we should feel empathy towards Arthur despite his evil actions, they are part of the system which caused this trouble in the first place. Mental health does not exist in a vacuum; it is interrelated with a society and a system which does not care for people with disadvantage. Crimes rates soar and the community demands protection and justice; justice is served by detention and alienation. The cycle repeats itself until society is tricked to believing that there is a singular person to blame, but the imperfections of the system and lack of support from society is creating more Jokers than one movie discussing its subject matter. For this reason, Joker is bold, novel and technically perfect, it is a movie for the Ages, akin to that of There Will be Blood and Taxi Driver. It is a character study like no other!"
89,"It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand. The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive. The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture. Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to."
90,"There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a dishonest, knee-jerk defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their gaslighting charade might get uncovered. It is not Joker that is delusional, it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.

But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.

When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.

All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypo crites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is."
91,"A breath of fresh air

Think heath ledgers joker in taxi driver with a game of thrones like soundtrack"
92,"I heard all the hype about this film and as a skeptic at heart I came into this film with the most critical mindset possible.

I just finished watching it and I am absolutely speechless. I don't think a film such as this has ever been made in Hollywood before. The slow and steady fall of the Joker into complete insanity is just so realistic that you feel a strange empathy towards him and almost come to justify his actions even when he commits the most heinous crimes. This is what makes this film so incredible, it takes the ""villain/good guy"" type of film making and just flips it right on its head.

The cinematography captures this perfectly, you never feel rushed into a scene and yet it keeps you glued to your seat (thanks also to the music and score which contour this film perfectly).

Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the century and only thanks to his brilliance is this film even possible. I feel sorry for the actors who gave Oscar-worthy performances this year, as Mr. Phoenix's acting in this film is just from another planet and deserves all the accolades it can get."
93,"Never thought anyone could perform the joker character better then heath ledger. I think the dc fans will love the movie but it wont be for everyone but i would say give it a try and decide your self dont rely only on the reviews.

Strong points of this film are the story background score and performances specaily the joker if your looking for all these things in a film then this is for you."
94,The movie is highly overrated...the character building was spot on and so is the Joaquin phoenix's performance... Extremely low on entertainment value...a very dark movie... 5 stars for Joaquin and 2 for the makers
95,"Joker is a contemporary example of a chef-d'oeuvre. It's a monumental piece of art. In essence, it's a masterpiece. Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix in a once in a lifetime portrayal of an iconic comic book villain. Barring any connection to the source material, Joker stands on its own as a film that will be upheld in the annals of the decade's best films.

Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a mentally unstable man who is trying to find his place in a society that rejects him. Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur is perfection. Phoenix captures the essence of life with mental illness. In a career with so many masterful character portrayals, this is the one that viewers will cite as Phoenix's crown jewel. The emotion within the film supersedes great acting by taking a step into reality. Arthur Fleck is a character that is written so well and so real that it hurts. Where much of the media stigmatizes mental illness, the character of Arthur Fleck humanizes it.

The cinematography in this movie is incredible. 2019 has been a year of great camera work, and this film spearheads the year. There are many iconic scenes layered throughout the film that are phenomenally shot. As the movie progresses, the film grows exceptionally in terms of cinematography. At times it is hard to tell whether the movie was shot digitally or on film. Essentially, this movie bridges the gaps between new wave cinema and contemporary cinema in a graceful manner. The lighting used within the film is atmospheric and successfully matches Arthur's mood throughout the film. The cinematography is masterful.

This film is a Dramatic, Psychological Thriller with a great twist. The writing is insanely clever. The suspense is uncanny. The ending is satisfying and chilling. The supporting cast are great. They add weight to Arthur's emotion, successfully building him up and progressing his development. The soundtrack is iconic. The music enhances the overall experience as opposed to watering it down with noise. This film is damn near perfection. Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix created a modern masterpiece

Overall, Joker is a classic in the making. It challenges the stigma surrounding mental illness, presenting a narrative coupled with classism. This movie is important. In a zeitgeist where mental instability is a common issue, this film gives voice to the voiceless."
96,"Mentally disturbed clown who wants to be a comedian. How he imagines things like it is happening to him in real-life and this really disturbs him, along with the disrespect he gets from the people around him, and brings him in with his alter-ego and our beloved character, Joker 🃏 P.S. Joaquin is brilliant in this."
97,"A mentally ill person without talents (or intelligence) cannot become a super villain just because he is angry. He will only be a mentally ill person with no talents (and intelligence) in anger. Nothing more. As a film, Joker lacks creativity or depth. In all senses. Unfortunately Joker did for the iconical character the same thing that Twilight did for vampire films."
99,This was amazing. DC needs to stick with the serious and more realistic stuff. I haven't seen a DC movie this good since the Nolan Dark Knight films. I was not expecting to ever feel bad for the Joker. The fact that some of the media doesn't get this movie is kinda ironic.
100,"Honestly, the performance given by Joaquin Phoenix in this movie, is phenomenal! He is absolutely superb - words fail me how moving his acting is in this film!!"
101,"Best Joker adaption ever, everything dark you'd want from such a character and I smiled throughout! Well worth every penny. Perfect amount of madness and incredible soundtrack. I don't even have complaints I am very satisfied - I absolutely love the profoundness in it. Joaquin Phoenix and Health Ledger are the best Jokers we'll have. I really hope this get nominated for the Oscars I'd dance a wild jig! Also this is my 550th review which is really cool!"
102,"Upon my first viewing of this film, my eyes were glued to the screen from beginning to end, and has remained that way ever since. Delivering one of the best performances of his career, Joaquin Phoenix portrays a character that is somewhat genuine yet overall unnerving to watch. His performance adds a layer to the Joker character that has never been captured in a film before. The range of emotion that is told through each of his facial expressions creates a subtly to his portrayal, allowing the viewer to be encapsulated as they watch the downfall of a clearly mentally ill man. The story is beautifully told, capturing the essence of the character through presenting his story as it was always meant to be told, multiple choice. This is perfectly executed by taking place within the mind of the character to immerse the viewer into his disturbing outlook on the world and the cruelty he faces. What this film has to say feels genuine in its execution, shining light on mental illness and society's role in turning a blind eye to it. By grounding the story in a real-world setting, the messages are allowed to feel timeless due to their ever-present significance. This is brilliantly illustrated by a score that, through its riveting string quartet, is allowed to encapsulate the disturbing tone of the film and the feelings the characters face. The cinematography provides an eerie feel to the film, characterizing Gotham as a disgusting infestation, filled to the brim with corruption and filth. This film is an overall masterpiece of how to make an artistic comic book film. Providing a respectful origin, cinematic characteristics, and one of the best performances put to film, this film is an experience that will capture the viewer's attention and never let go."
103,"Wow impeccable timing and acting pulled off something special.

Have to recommend this film despite how it makes you feel."
104,"This movie is probably about a 7.2. It is pretty enjoyable. It isn't as good as the people who are paid to post fake reviews here claim but those people are easily discovered by the fact that they rate every move 10/10.

It is worse than the Dark Knight and I didn't find the Joker better than Heath's or Jack Nicholson's This isn't an action movie so people going into it expecting that won't get it but it is a good character study which unfortunately may be boring to many people. Reminded me of There Will be Blood than Batman"
107,"But the 10 star reviews that came flooding in were too much for me to take seriously, and I was right.

By all means, go see Joker - it's a standalone origin story that needs no knowledge of the Batman series, but it also rewards fans of that series with some very convincing details and very believable storytelling.

I won't get into the plot, but there are some twists. Very well done, in fact, even though they are both reminiscent of certain M. Knight Shymalan films. Very tastefully done and expertly integrated into the storyline without overindulgence and quite important for the story and character arcs at play. Bravo in that respect.

Also, applause for the cinematography, the style, the homages to previous classics and just the wonderfully realistic atmosphere that the director and his crew were able to bring to life here. Positively the most believable and realistic Gotham ever. Some might find that to be a veiled critique, but it makes this film watchable and enjoyable by those who have no knowledge of the Batman franchise(s).

Just altogether airtight production and direction. Hands down.

The only gripe I have is with the score - not the songs, necessarily, but the use of over-dramatic violin/cello passages and too-loud unnecessary (and very dark) orchestral pieces that almost take the audience out of the experience. Those who have seen it may know what I am talking about, but no spoilers.

All in all, this is very much worth watching even if I feel as though it may spawn some copycats in real life - sure to have a long ""cult film"" life after it fades from the cinemas.

7.5/10 with no caveats."
108,"The whole point of this movie is to bring attention to mental illness (I'll do you one better and name a bigger issue than mental illness that the film barely focuses on; the lack of quality mental healthcare) but the film completely discredits its own message with a one dimensional depiction of most of the world and characters that inhabit it. It seems that Gotham and its citizens (the entire universe for that matter) only exists to put Arthur down and considering the film isn't told from Arthur's perspective, it is a blatantly stupid depiction of the world. The reason why people liked it so much is because the sad corporate slaves (especially the youth currently being indoctrinated) were subconsciously tricked into believing they were part of some bigger cause when they were really just sitting in their comfy chairs."
109,"While I usually find the argument ""Don't listen to the critics"" childish, I will make an exception for this movie. It's FAR from the violence inciting slop the media is painting it as. Joker is a near masterpiece that, while definitely borrowing elements from other films like Taxi Driver, stands on its own as a fantastic film. Joaquin Pheonix does an incredible job and delivers one of his greatest performances as Arthur Fleck/The Joker. Pheonix really makes you feel sympathy for Arthur even if the things that he does are morally wrong and not defendable in the slightest. If you wanted a comic-book film that was more grounded in realism and 100x grittier than The Dark Knight trilogy, then this might be the movie you've always dreamed of. But the brutal violence and disturbing nature of the film is so masterfully done that it can't be dismissed as ""disgusting"" or bad because the movie is simply doing it's job well. It didn't exactly get me emotional, but it was very hard-hitting at times and some scenes had me on the edge of my seat. I think if it was a tad more original in some areas then it would be a damn near masterpiece, but overall, Joker is an amazing film that should definitely be seen at least once."
110,I don't need to elaborate more - A masterpiece performance to the highest order. This is psychologically revolutionary portrayal of a deranged character.
111,"When I first heard of the joker movie and the cast and director, I was skeptical. Sure I love Todd Phillips and his Hangover movies, ya I like Joaquin phoenix. But it was interesting to see their names attached to this movie.

When the initial trailer dropped for the movie; I thought to myself, ""this is either going to be one among the most amazing films, or well quite the opposite"". I thought it was a real roll of the dice to make and put this out for all to see.

And oh boy did they make the right call! Everything in this movie is astounding! The performances are among the best I've ever seen, HUGE SHOUTOUT TO JOAQUIN! The cinematography, various settings, the color grading, and oh don't get me started on soundtrack! It is all more than I ever could've hoped for and imagined.

This release for Phillips shows his true geniusness and versatility as a director. He dared to execute his unique vision and take and it couldn't have paid off any better. An extra shoutout to how the entire movie is shot from Arthur's perspective, and it never breaks from that!

This isn't a movie to just watch and enjoy; it is one to be studied and contemplated. This piece of art is beautiful and I couldn't be happier to have witnessed it!"
112,This movie is slow but never makes you feel bored. The story is narrated in a wonderful manner. This movie sets a good example for others comic based movies that how can a negative character can be portrayed in such a manner that you though know joker in not a good man but will be feeling bad for him at some point. The acting done by Joaquin Phoenix who played the role of joker was amazing. He was flawless and did proper justice with the character of joker which very few actors were able to do. Joaquin Phoenix is a brilliant method actor. This is a movie made to see in movie theatre not at tv or any streaming app.
115,"What kind of Joker is this? The kind that cries on the inside.

This is a Gotham Horror. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips has gone through Martin Scorsese's filmography ranging from Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Bringing Out the Dead to Shutter Island. Robert De Niro appears as a chat show host just to drive home the Scorsese connections.

The Joker delivers a bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. He is one of life's losers. Unable to hold down a job as a clown and on seven different kinds of medications but he is still a manic depressive.

Set in the early 1980s, Gotham City is in the sewers and there are sightings of giant rats. Social services funding cuts means that Fleck is on his own. The social worker who does not even listen to him is not going to be there for him any more.

Like Travis Bickle, Fleck snaps and is then reborn as the Joker. The Joker is not political but this nihilistic slow burn drama takes aim at wealthy Democrat and Republican politicians alike.

Thomas Wayne might not be painted as a Trump, but he is a rich tycoon who thinks the 'have nots' are clowns. Watch out for the scene when the moguls dressed in tuxedos are watching a screening of Chaplin's Modern Times. A movie that commented on the desperate conditions many people faced during the 1930s Depression.

Joker is a bold comic strip adaptation but it is a low wattage film with no plot. It is a tribute act because of the Scorsese movies that inspired it."
116,"Since Joaquin Phoenix was announced to play the Joker, i was on the front of the hype train and usually that leads to disappointment, but NOT this time!

This movie has such a gritty and realistic attitude towards it that my girlfriend (who has no clue about comics or Batman but i dragged her along into this!) asked me if this was based on a true story.

Yes, the similarities to Taxi Driver, Fight Club and The King Of Comedy are obvious, but that doesn't hurt the movie at all. Some things you might see coming, which i usually hate, but this movie manages to leave more questions open, that it answers, so the enjoyment doesnt end when the movie finishes, you can debate about your theories for hours.

I keep my reviews always spoiler free, I just wanna mention that I see what you tried here Todd Phillips, this movie is its own sequel - watch it and you'll understand

A lovely character study and instant classic that will never get old. 11 years after Heath Ledger, this might be the next Joker that walks away with the little golden man, at least a nomination seems guaranteed!

I can't stress enough how much i enjoyed that approach and would love to see more of these kind of movies, because this is what a comic adaptation really deserves."
118,"That should be the title, the worst possible situations solve the worse way possible, over and over, and this what people like? no wonder the World is the piece of crap that is today and going worse by the day, we deserve to be extinct."
119,I have watched this movie !!! Nah I was there. Todd phillips and joaquine phoenix just boomed the Theaters. Hat's off to you Sir's
120,"Joker is one of the best movie i've seen in 2019. The acting of Joaquin Phoenix is top class and of next level. He steals the show. He has buried himself deeper into the character. So much that it looks even more real than the Joker itself(Lmao, but serious ly). This movie also rasies a question that should rebel be considered as a crime?

Watch this masterpiece at least once in your life. It will surely change your view on a hero and a villian. A villan is not born bad but the environment he is raised in makes him do so...."
122,"Joaquin Phoenix transforms into the titular character and gives a performance worthy of his Oscar. 'Artistic' is the word is use to describe Joker. With a grimy production design, Hildur Guðnadóttir's abstract score, and some strong social messages, Joker departs itself from recent comic-book movies. A grim and intense drama with homages to Scorsese's flicks. Flawless."
123,"And I'm not saying you need to be a freak. Many of us play the role, put on the mask, pretend like it's all good and normal. But deep inside, we're all Joker.

This movie is a masterpiece and Joaqin is incredible. I don't think anyone could've done this movie as well as he did. Why? Because he's playing a role in real life. This was him just being him, the outcast."
124,"Who is the crazier one? The one who is able to adapt without contradiction to the conditions of a cynical, violent and morally corrupt time, or the one reacting on those conditions with uncompromising insanity, fighting back, using his own weapons of revenge, reflecting world's madness with an insane grimace? This is the disturbing question the film poses in the figure of The Joker, equally fascinating, frightening and pitifully embodied by Phoenix, an unforgettable performance with great depth and a wide range of emotions: a Travis Bickle for the 21st century, and Robert De Niro himself paying tribute to this 43 years later after his own legendary performance in Taxi Driver."
125,"This is the movie where the audience will like Joker but hate Thomas Wayne, Batman's father when they see how uncaring he is. This movie is going to be a classic hopefully!"
126,"Comic book movies can never reach the artistic level of real cinema, yet Joker comes close.

Flicks like The Dark Knight and The Batman want to have their cake and eat it too -- they want to be compared with their inspirations (Heat, Black Sunday; Klute, Se7en, Chinatown) and so they base their movie's logic in a ""grounded and realistic"" world, yet the studio requires them to sell as many tickets as possible. And so we get fantastical, well-choreographed fight scenes and constant explosions to wow the viewers. Joker never stoops to that level. Every moment of violence is chaotic and looks like it hurts, which cannot be said about a Batman who takes a 100 bullets because body armor is apparently magic. An R-rating frees Joker from restrictions even the grittiest PG-13 movies tend to have.

As the two aforementioned Batman movies take inspirations from their betters, Philips takes inspiration from Scorsese. Yet unlike The Batman which becomes so bogged down with its influences that it never finds its own voice, Joker retains originally and remains unpredictable throughout, paying respects without going into Tarantino ""homage"" territory.

Violence aside, this movie feels real. There is no obvious CGI present, and the colors always feel like natural lighting rather than a filter added in via Adobe After Effects. Joker is not a character with a flower on his shirt that squirts acid; this is an unhinged man with a gun railing about the injustices of society.

Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix have created the first live-action Joker post-Dark Knight that doesn't rely on Ledger -- there is no imitation of Ledger's voice as we see with Jared Leto and Barry Keoghan, and there is no mimicry of Ledger's mannerisms.

For all the praise The Batman's obvious sets and computer animated additions receive for being gritty, it doesn't compare to this Gotham. Every building is plagued with graffiti and trash is piled up on the streets, giving the impression that Gotham must smell foul. Everything from the Subway to Arthur's apartment is dilapidated.

Most importantly, Joker wants you to think for yourself. Philips might be a leftist, but he does not have an agenda to force on his audience. Philips doesn't try to force the viewers to think of Arthur as a loser (*cough*Reeve's twitch streaming Riddler*cough*) or to think of Murray and Thomas Wayne as corrupt (*cough*The Batman*cough*). It manages to remain politically and morally ambiguous. And for all we know, this is a story the Joker is telling his psychiatrist in Arkham. Or it was all just another daydream.

WB did not have faith in this project and the budget was kept to a respectable $50 million. Unfortunately, with the success of Joker, the studio will become more invested, which might mean less creative control for Philips.

77.91/100."
127,"First just to say that I would officially rate this a 9. It doesn't quite have the lasting all time greatness that for me, a score of 10 should be reserved for. The reason I gave it a10, is personal. I see so much of what is depicted in the film in real life. And no doubt many unlawful acts have been carried out by those pushed to the edge of society in the real world. Both the film generally, and the character resonated with me in a few different ways. To be clear, not with the intensity depicted in the film, not by any means, but in small ways such as imagining what I could do with my life but not having the courage to do it. I could go on for a while about the question of whether or not we do enough to stem the cycle of abuse and crime in our societies, but there is too much to cover and for me it also gets a bit philisophical. That does not mean to say that I think the matter is academic; far from it. It is because it is an issue which begs the questions of who we are and how we manage and regulate ourselves and our societies. I might watch this film again, but I'm not sure yet. It hits hard, and it hits deep. If you care to look, that is."
128,"This is not an easy watch. It's dark and disturbing to witness the Jokers life just prior to turning into the criminal mastermind he becomes. Joaquin Phoenix is very good as the Joker, his mannerisms and persona are consistent, meticulous and he carries the movie well. That leaves little else though for the cast around him. He's in pretty much every scene which makes the film intense and quite uneasy to watch as you see a man on severe medication get angrier and angrier. It's a good film but it wont leave you in a happy or rewarding mood after. There is a bit of Bruce Wayne in there which will leave you asking was there a 30+ year age gap between them?.... Anyway, if you'd like to see how the Joker becomes bad here it is."
129,"Phoenix was over the top spooky and I guess very good in this role, but as a movie there wasnt much there. His mom played by Frances Conroy was good. I admire her talent, DeNiro doesnt move me much the past few years (decades?) and his teeth look like Martin Scorsese used some CGI magic left over from the Irishman to whiten them. I think the high rating for the film here are based on Phoenix's performance and not the film. A performance which I fear we will one day view as overrated."
130,"Prepare to be devastated by Joker. Not so much by the intense madness and blood-spewing violence that is sometimes hard to watch, or the overwhelming central performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the title role, but by the vision and artistry of the film itself. Even if you hate it, it's unlike anything you've ever seen before-like waking up next to a poisonous snake nestled on your blanket, poised and ready to strike. You're horrified but unable to move. Regardless of my mixed feelings, I think it's the best film about the psychological effect of violence as pop art since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.

Vigorously directed by Todd Phillips, who also co-wrote the unique if uneven screenplay with Scott Silver, and beautifully shot by Lawrence Sher, Joker traces the history of the popular DC Comics villain and Batman's arch enemy in totally original terms. After award-winning performances by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in the role, you may think you know the Joker, but who is he and where did he come from?"
131,"It was pretty clear from before the movie got released that despite being a central comic book villain, Joker would not be anywhere along the lines of any superhero/super villain film we've ever seen. Instead of having the clown of Gotham going on a mad rampage to burn down the city, we witness an origin story for Joker : a story of how a normal if not slightly delusional person on being bogged down by society can turn into an uncontrollable, cold-blooded madman that we all know of.

Joker's alter ego Arthur Fleck's struggles makes it immensely relatable and it is amazing to watch the character develop throughout the film. Joaquin Phoenix never fails, delivering a strong performance and proving that he is one of the best, most devoted method actors in the industry.

Joker rides on a simple plot fueled by a cast of extraordinary actors and a spine-chilling soundtrack which goes perfect with the protagonist's actions. With a couple of gory scenes, the movie can feel a bit heavy to handle. The movie, with beautiful cinematography ,successfully captures the essence Prince Clown of Gotham!"
134,Dark and very entertaining. Hoping for a joker 2. Would love to see Batman from the view of the joker
136,"Joker portrayed the slow decent into madness in a phenomenal way. This was more than a DC movie- it was a psychological rabbit hole.

There were so many moments of deep cringe- it was almost too much to endure. But that's exactly why it was such an extraordinary film.

Movies often glaze over and glamorize insanity. This movie highlights the uncomfortable and disturbing moments that others don't touch."
137,"Strong fanboy and hype rush going on. The movie is good don't get me wrong, the cinematography is amazing, the acting is brilliant, but the story is a bit predictable if you have an iq above 90. Its also really slow paced which can be annoying at times. Deff has it flaws and is in no way even comparable to Batman the dark knight. The movie is a 7 but I gave it a 6 to compensate for all the fanboy 10s"
138,"People told me this was an intense movie, and seems like my friends either loved or hated it so I had to watch it. It's one to watch a few times though because there is a lot of layers of themes and subtext going on. Mental illness, social injustice, relationships, to just name a few. Joaquin Phoenix nailed the role and was captivating in his portrayal of mentally ill Arthur Fleck. Todd Philips is masterful in his directing of this film. It was disturbing and made me think for several days afterwards about people, life, situations, and how we treat each other."
139,"So they stole King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, put it on a comic book character, made a self indulgent snooze fest, and get oscars for it. Only redeeming qualities are the score and the performances. It does what is sets out to achieve, but not without stealing form Scorsese.

Edit: After a rewatch, I drove up the score 2 more stars. The copying is still blatant, but the score, performances, and cinematography are great. Direction is also pretty good. Still overrated."
140,"Reviewing ""Joker"" in ""The New Yorker,"" the great film critic Anthony Lane called it a ""lurid spectacle"" and a ""miserablist manifesto."" Other IMDB user reviews give away the plot, so I won't recap it, and the film FAQ in this database provides an exceptionally lengthy explanation for all the bewildering plot twists and possible motivations for Joaquin Phoenix's disturbing portrayal of a psychopathic killer with so many mental disorders it is impossible to name them all. Watching this film is like being subjected to a two-hour nightmare--not of anything in the viewer's brain or for that matter in the mind of the main character--unless it's a reminder to take your meds. No, it's all about the writer/director's attempt to cash in on our national cynicism. Although the movie pretends to be on the side of the poor, the abused, and the downtrodden, it also suggests that the evil media, the complacent rich, law enforcement, social workers, and just about every sane person in ""Gotham"" (read New York City) is part of an evil cabal that has taken control of the world. Just in case serial killer John Wayne Gacy didn't sound the death knell for professional clowns, this movie tries its best to do so. Other good films have been made about the insane taking over the asylum but never with this much cold calculated cash in mind and so little insight into insanity itself.

""I happen to dislike the film as heartily as anything I've seen in the past decade,"" Anthony Lane said in his September 2019""New Yorker"" review, ""but I realize, equally, that to vent any inordinate wrath toward it is to fall straight into its trap, for outrage merely proves that our attention has been snagged. Just ask the President of the United States."""
141,"There isn't much else to say; Joker is one of the most absorbing, powerful films ever made. The cinematography is remarkable and the score is just perfectly potent and understated. This is not a thrill-a-minute movie designed to keep you entertained throughout. It is a heavy, all-consuming character study that invites you, with reluctance and fascination, into the mind of a severely disturbed outcast. I don't remember any movie leaving me feeling so emotionally disoriented as I left the cinema.

The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is something very special indeed. We spend nearly the full two hours just watching him close up and every second is exhilarating. Rarely, if ever, has a character been so utterly captivating, so desperate and so tragic. His physical acting, from writhing in anguish to dancing with warped delight, is utterly mesmerising. And not once did he ever lay it on too thick. To portray that level of pain and fury without indulging in excess morbidity or melodrama is quite an achievement.

Forget where this masterpiece fits into the world of DC comics and Batman movies; Joker is a stand-alone film that deservedly takes its place amongst the greats."
142,"People criticising this film for being 'dark and disturbing' is purely hypocritical, in my opinion. When you're making a film about the world's most twisted mind, the end result is bound to be dark and disturbing. If not, then the movie clearly hasn't captured what it means to be turned into the Joker. It doesn't matter whether this film has derived inspiration from a few previous films or any other source for that matter; by itself, this film is unique, classy and a sheer masterpiece."
143,"This movie is as dark and morbid as they come. Don't expect this film to have anything to do with Batman or even the joker. They could've just made a film about a random person that struggles with mental health issues and it would've been a winner. Yes, it's a film about how the Joker came to be but for me, it was more than that. There's a much darker yet relatable story that it tells. It's almost a documentary about the very real illness that MANY of us face but are too scared to reveal until breaking point. The addition of the Joker, well, that's just a bonus. It's not often that a film can make you sympathise with the villain especially after some of the gruesome acts he does, yet, somehow by the end, you can't help but be on his side which actually makes you feel a little uncomfortable after the movies over. Brilliant film, incredible acting and certainly plays on your mind for a while after."
144,"There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a bad faith defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their charade might get uncovered. Joker might be delusional, but it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.

But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.

When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.

All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypocrites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is."
145,"Saw this at the cinema and came out speechless

His acting was incredibly good, some say might not have actually been acting but I'm giving him full credit.

From the story to the production to the acting was flawless

Be warned that mental illness feature heavily in this movie so use discretion if this subject upsets you."
146,"This is not your typical comic book movie. No superpowers, superheroes or end-of-the world scenarios. In fact, there's not really any modern special effects. If the ""Joker"" wasn't one of a most culturally recognizable villains, this movie may not have the wide impact it's having.

However - he is a central character in the DC comic universe. This movie gives him a plausible, wildly dark and often sad origin story. This would not be the same movie without Phoenix's eccentric performance. He made it disturbing and believable. If he wins the Oscar for lead actor, it will be the second time someone won an Oscar for being the Joker (the other being Heath Ledger in 2009).

The story may hit a deep note with many people who've felt disenfranchised, alienated or ignored by society or their families. For 2 hours, I felt drawn into the world and crazed reality of the main character, Arthur Fleck (aka Joker). For that - I have to say it was a compelling watch."
147,Joaquin Phoenix is an outstanding actor very well deserved the oscar. He's been acting in good movies for a while now. I hope he continues making great movies and entertaining and powerful messages.
148,"In ""Joker,"" I don't see a film worthy of an Oscar nomination for best picture, I don't see a film worthy of high praise. All I see are 45 boring minutes of an identity-less film, an intense third act and a great and Oscar-worthy performance from Joaquin Phoenix."
151,"Joaquin Phoenix just playing Joaquin Phoenix. Boring, Twisted, Sick piece of crap. A one and done movie."
153,"This is a stunning piece of work from JP and director Todd Phillips , totalling exceeded expectations and a truly Oscar worthy performance. A mesmerising tour de force from start to finish...excellent"
154,"First, I really love Joaquin Phoenix as an actor. I think he is clearly underrated. Second, he have had an amazing career before Joker's role, just check IMDB. Last, if you want to enjoy an amazing acting masterclass, this movie is for you. To sum up, I didn't read anything about Joker's movie and the hype is real, in my opinion. Do not trust haters, just watch it, and enjoy real cinema. I'm still listening Joker's laugh inside my brain. Amazing."
155,"Great storyline, and great acting. There should be multiple awards for acting, directing, cinematography, etc. perfectly done! Feel almost bad for the joker :-)"
157,"There has been a vocal split from the critics about whether this movie is a dark masterpiece or a deliberately problematic film that elicits sympathy for those who shouldn't get it. I get where the critics are coming from with Joker being a disruptive and atypical superhero movie but I just don't agree. I never saw Arthur as the hero of this movie and I think if you look hard enough, the movie doesn't present it that way either. We spend so much time with him that you can't help but feel sorry for him but his actions are still despicable and he's locked up in the end for good reason. He's a sympathetic villain at best and while Joker definitely shows a fresh perspective for a comic book movie, I don't think there's some sinister motivation to incite hate. Todd Phillips (the writer/director here) tends to lean towards darker characters, darker humour and darker motivations and this movie seems like an evolution of his work. It was interesting to get the superhero story from the other perspective, the villain who has been ignored and beaten up by society and who was sick but couldn't get the help he needed. It was an inspired decision to tell the story this way and I was enthralled when I watched Joker without being tricked into thinking he was some tragic hero in disguise. Could this movie be interpreted that way? Yes but that's dependent on the viewer and I can't penalize the movie for that.

When a movie is set in the crappy part of town, a city ghetto or even a post-apocalyptic world, you don't expect to be impressed by cinematography or editing or costuming but this movie was impressive in all those areas. It's beautifully shot and the editing is seamless. It really helps blur the lines between what is actually happening to Arthur and what he's imagining but its done in a very artistic way. The movie feels authentic because of how grimy and dismal the setting is and I liked that they went back to a more conventional look for the Joker as opposed to Suicide Squad which really swung for the fences but missed the mark. The makeup even plays an important roll in how Arthur acts and that was well done. This movie looks great and with all the hype surrounding it, I was looking for pitfalls when I saw this in the theatre. But Joker was up to the task, I also enjoyed the score minus one song which felt like someone accidentally hit the shuffle button in iTunes. The score is largely comprised of songs previous to or from that era and then in a montage there's some arena rock. Luckily its cuts off quickly and this is only a minor complaint.

Joker is centred around Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who will eventually become the Joker. I loved how well developed he was as a character. Its not always the classic Joker origin you may or may not be familiar with. I've talked a little bit already about how's he not a hero but I saw this as a story of someone who had some well earned (through little to no fault of his own) psychotic tendencies and when he really needed help, he was cast aside or just ignored by both those in power and those few individuals in his life. He tries to keep going but it becomes too much and once his switch is flipped, there's just no going back for Arthur. Almost all of his relationships with those around him (minus Sophie which has BIG issues in a different way) are flawed and toxic. I also liked how his motivations evolved pretty naturally as the movie went on. This is not a justification of his thought process but the movie illustrates how he moved from A) to B) to C) and it never seemed too implausible for this genre. Inorganic character motivations drive me nuts and I was pleasantly surprised at how all the events in Joker added up.

The part of the Joker comes with a stigma after Heath Ledger and while Jared Leto is a great actor, his portrayal of the iconic character was definitely polarizing. Phoenix has a reputation of being a gifted actor, entirely committing to his roles and being an oddball for a leading man. His portrayal of Arthur is right up there with Ledger for me. I wouldn't say better or worse but Phoenix lives up to the legacy. He's got strong material to work with but he makes Arthur both sympathetic yet frightening. His story is tragic but he could explode at any moment. He shaped his body for the part and from the first moments past the opening credits, its very clear he's in 100%. He'll get awards recognition and its deserved. I haven't seen a performance this year that I would say is better.

The supporting cast is definitely there in service of Arthur but they feature some excellent work too. I was surprised Robert DeNiro was in this so much as Murray Franklin but he fit in this movie pretty well. He's not hammy yet he carries his part and he was legitimately good in this. Zazie Beetz was a solid choice for Sophie. Her relationship with Arthur is problematic (it was also my biggest gripe with the movie but they answered my questions pretty definitively by the end) but that's her character, not her. She's beautiful and its easy to see why she's on her way up. Frances Conroy is also doing great work, her character is essential to who Arthur is and her role in this is also pretty tragic. I would also credit Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne, he's a pretty ambiguous character through Arthur's eyes and his performance is in tune with this movie

This is a GREAT movie that hopefully represents a shift in the comic book genre. Whether you love this movie completely or hate its guts, its a changeup for the genre and I would argue that it was needed. We need more bold ideas like this for the superhero movie to continue to dominate. Is the Joker an uncomfortable movie? Absolutely! I was uneasy the entire time and I shifted in my seat a lot during the squeamish parts. Is it a fun movie to watch? I would also say no, its methodically paced and with all the uncomfortable bits, its thoroughly unpleasant. But when it comes to the quality of the movie, this is a TRIUMPH! The acting is fantastic, its masterfully shot and tightly written and the ending packs a real gut-punch. Its one of the few times that I thought about the ending after and realized that I don't know if anything else would have been true to the story and the character. I would love a sequel but I don't think Joker has to have one. The arc of the story opens and closes artfully and the creative team might be better served by leaving it alone. Fantastic work from Phoenix, Phillips, the creative team and the supporting players make this a must-see. It will end up in my 2019 top 5. If you haven't already, check this out and see where you weigh in."
158,"'Joker (2019)' is one of the most intense and disturbing films I've seen in a long time. It really is surprisingly fantastic, an unsettling and complex character-study that's as uncompromising as it is gripping. Inspiration was clearly taken from 'The King Of Comedy (1982)' and, to a lesser degree, 'Taxi Driver (1976)', but this isn't just a cut-and-paste copy. It's very much its own beast, as much a horror movie as it is a comic-book one. Don't let Phillips fool you, by the way, this certainly is a comic-book movie. It's a phenomenal comic-book movie that blows almost all others out of the water, but a comic-book movie nonetheless. It takes inspiration from several well-known storylines and has a firm grasp on both its titular character and all the other classic Gotham elements, much more so than one might expect given the marketing. None of this is meant as a slight, just an exploration of the fact that comic-book movies are ""real"" movies. Here, we have a probable career-best performance from Phoenix, who's often frightening even when sitting still, and a definite career-best directorial effort from Phillips, who seems to have elevated himself far beyond the generally well-regarded 'The Hangover (2009)'. The whole thing is just so well-made, clearly crafted with absolute clarity of vision from the very beginning. The screenplay is great, the cinematography is gorgeous and the musical score is outright masterful. The flick works so well because it doesn't pretend there are 'heroes and villains'. You don't really identify with the protagonist, you pity him. You want him to be okay, to find a way out of his inevitably dark situation, but certainly aren't cheering along with him when things eventually get even worse. There's no 'good guy', just a guy. He undergoes some serious trauma and, often, the piece elicits a strong emotional response when this happens. Yet, when he decides to deal with it in a criminal way, you're never 'on his side'. Instead, you just watch in shock and horror, glued to the edge of your seat. Indeed, the violence here is some of the most impactful I've seen, each moment punching you straight in the gut. It's not fun, it's horrible and that's how it should be. There's no doubt that this is an amazing feature. It's absolutely gripping and I can't stress that enough. It gets under your skin and wriggles around, as interesting to reflect on as it is to watch. It's not exactly 'nice' but it's not supposed to be. It's brave, realistic stuff that's easily up there, right at the top, as one of the best of the year. As a footnote, I just can't believe how well they incorporated the Joker's classic laugh into a piece as grounded as this; it's chilling, tragic and integral to the character, yet still as over-the-top as you'd think (though, you might not realise it when it happens). Honestly, I still can't quite comprehend how good this whole affair is. It's simply divine.

After a second watch, my option of the piece has dampened somewhat. It certainly doesn't have the impact that it used to. Plus, it clearly is a rip-off of 'The King Of Comedy (1982)' that Phillips, by his own admission, simply slapped a 'Joker' title on so that producers would take notice. Still, it's an effective film overall. It's just not as effective as I initially thought. I'll leave the rest of the review as it is, though, as I think there is some value in a 'first impression' of the piece; it clearly affected me the first time around, so deserves praise for that even if its impact has lessened on a rewatch.

8/10."
159,"For someone who does not understand the background of the role of joker, watching this movie is very confusing in some aspects. In particular, the narrative of the movie itself is intertwined with reality. I can understand that maybe this is an artistic expression, but maybe it can be edited better. It is undeniable that the theme of the movie and the performance of the actors are excellent."
160,"This movie reminded me of Kubrick's version of Stephen King's THE SHINING. It has the same sense of darkness enveloping the characters. But, like Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), Arthur Fleck is manic - a maniac, really - from the start. The violence escalates (and how - I can't believe this movie got away with a 15 rating), but there's no real explanation of what made Arthur the way he is. Thanks to all the other movies in the Batman franchise, we know where the Joker is headed, but we need an 'origins' prequel to this one.

Robert de Niro, playing a talk-show host, brings a reminder of dark roles he has vividly brought to life. But Joaquin Phoenix's performance, like Heath Ledger's in 2008, is a tour-de-force: over the top, and then some.

A deeply disturbing movie. And worryingly likely to be seen as celebrating violence."
161,"Great acting by Joaquin, but, really, could movies get any darker? The whole thing was uncomfortable to me--I guess that's the point."
163,"Watched this in theathre, everyone including me was glued to see the transformation of Arthur.

To me, this movie simply is 'almost perfect'."
164,"I was blown away by the script and performance. Artistic, gritty, brilliant. Oscar for Todd and Joaquin."
165,"Normally I write the long review, but I'm going to keep it simple and concise this time.

Without spoiling anything -- I suggest you do not read critics' reviews and watch this with a moderate expectation -- this film is an unexpected masterpiece, and the best comic book-based adaptation since Superman (1978).

I have seen plenty of superhero movies, and I concur with Martin Scorsese's criticism of that as ""not cinema"" even though I differ with Scorsese's own output as self-indulgent and pretentious (in particular The Departed and Hugo were bloated and awful).

However, Joker should be officially considered ""kino"" which is German for cinema, and utilized as a code of sorts among the Internet culture crowd to indicate ""encore; masterpiece; outstanding"".

Watching this achieved something I did not expect, and that is of astonishment and catharsis. For that, my hat off to the reformed DC studio (which fired CEO after Justice League movie as a mega-flop to replace with a new leader) and Warner Bros that gave Todd Phillips and co. the chance to produce the bravest ""heavy and dark with the purpose"" cinema since, say, Fight Club, the latter I disliked but understood its messages.

Joaquin Phoenix will not only own the Best Actor Oscar, but also that this film will sweep the Oscars with Todd winning Best Director and possibly Best Picture (Bradley Cooper being one of the producers)."
166,"I miss Heath Ledger and can't get enough of his portrayal of Joker. He was intimidating, scary, unpredictable and all other things. In 2016, we got Suicide Squad and Jared Leto as Joker both of which disappointed me very much. After that, I thought that I don't want to see another Joker interpretation on the big screen. I was skeptical when I heard that a standalone Joker movie was in works. Then I heard about the casting of Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and I developed an interest in it because I love his work. He is a method actor and has given some of my favorite performances for example in Her (2013) and The Master (2012). I decided to see the movie in the theater after hearing a lot about the movie, good and bad and I am glad that I saw it.

This movie is really good, it exceeded my expectations and Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his work. He is phenomenal and I was blown away by his performance. His performance alone carries the whole movie and lets you experience and understand the character without saying much. His physique, movements, gestures, grace, way of speaking suggests that he gave his everything to make the character compelling and stand out from other Joker portrayals. He lost 52 pounds for the role. He embodied the character of Joker. Comparing his performance with Heath Ledger will be absurd. There is no common ground for comparison. Both interpretations of Joker are significantly different, the story is different, character motivations are different.

Now talking about the story, this is a standalone Joker movie that shows how a man beaten up, neglected and humiliated by the society turns into a maniac. This movie follows Arthur Fleck who works as a party clown and lives with his mother. He wants to be a stand-up comic. He suffers from a condition causing him to laugh uncontrollably. We feel his loneliness, depression, and condition and sympathize with him for it. All the other performances were also very good. This movie isn't that much violent as people are saying it to be, but it makes you feel the violence and it is unsettling. It also allows the viewer to form their perspective about the character. Sometimes you will agree with his actions and sometimes you won't. There are also certain funny scenes in the movie but not everyone may find it funny.

The movie is directed by Todd Phillips and he has done an outstanding job. I didn't think that the guy who made The Hangover movies can pull this off, but he did it. He showed that as a filmmaker, he can make more than just R rated comedies. The film is set in 1981 and the period is very well reflected in the movie. The cinematography is top-notch. Shot composition, camera placement, camera movement has been handled well. I was surprised by how good the Gotham city looked, beautiful and dirty at the same time. Each scene had a color scheme. The lights in the surroundings like light from streetlights, cars or the sky illuminated everything with their light. Joker/Arthur Fleck's emotions get conveyed through shades of light falling on him which is beautiful to look at. Music is beautiful, chilling, hypnotizing and speak lengths about the inner feelings of the character.

I have just a few issues with the plot of the movie and how some things happen which shouldn't have happened or couldn't have happened, rest the movie is flawless."
167,"Joker. Where do I even begin. Never expected a comic book movie to talk about such serious issues that we face today in the world. Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated and what role we play in helping mentally ill people and how they're treated. The best part about Joker is that it never takes a position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur guðnadóttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is a surreal, out of body experience. Some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance where you don't even wanna blink while watching. And these are just my thoughts on the film, Either way, go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say."
168,"Joker is a unique experience It is more than a movie. It is very relatable, there are still a lot of jokers out there who are being bullied and mistreated day in and day out this movie speaks for the weak and unheard voices of the society we live in."
169,Amazing atmosphere in the movie! Joaquin Phoenix is gorgeous! Great script and dark soundtrack. The film addresses issues such as social injustice and loneliness. The ending was super. Joaqin deserves an Oscar!
170,"Although Phoenix delivered an outstanding performance, the story is poor. Very long dialogues in the beginning, some action but finally the end is disappointing. This is not worth a 10."
171,"Beautifully acted and beautiful story.

Refreshing to watch compared to most films in 2019."
172,At the risk of sounding edgy I'll just come out and say it. Joker is a pretty medicore movie. Does it has absolutely marvelous Oscar deserving acting of Joaquin phoenix? Yes. Does it talk about a touchy topic like mental illness? Yes but is it up there with the all time greats? No absolutely not. The story is pretty predictable and straight forward underdog guy rises up against the Machine and seizes the moment. This movie with a different script had the potential to be cinema gold. Just do a test apart from Joaquin whose character do you remember? Right? They made Robert de Niro forgettable! Not a easy thing to do. Don't follow the hype watch and judge.
173,"Characters that suffer abuse can be a good element in a plot. But audience should never suffer abuse. The audience needs to experience catharsis in the end. And this never happens with 'Joker'. The film has a huge problem, which it never manages to solve: it wants to be realistic and tell the tale of an innocent, abused individual who snaps; but it also wants to exist within a fictional universe in which this man is as much of an abuser as he is a victim. And this creates problems for the screenwriters that they never manage to solve. Thus Joker comes across as a sympathetic character first, but turns to a vicious killer towards the end, at which point everyone becomes confused, and stops liking him. There is no redemption of any kind, no satisfying emotional resolution, only a brutal ending which serves the purposes of the wider franchise and doesn't deliver on its own terms. In the end, the character we were made to empathize with becomes nothing but a caricature in a silly superhero universe. And that is an insult to anyone who invested in the character from the beginning. The audience is cheated. Also, one should note the disturbing anarchist/communist vibe in the film - the idea that it's better to burn down the world than allow their particular understanding of 'injustice' to go on. I may pity Joker and hate the cynical Wayne, but I won't put degenerate, mentally ill clown in charge of an angry mob that wants to burn everything down."
174,Without doubt one of the best movie's that I've ever seen!
177,"A movie like this, only comes along when the stars are aligned... The director Todd Phillips, can know he did the impossible... He made the audience feel, what it would be like to be in the head of the ""Joker"" All the loneliness and feeling out of place. This brilliant movie should have swept the Oscars. Now we know the Oscars, are more political than what real art is. How horrible to laugh, when it's not appropriate. I was uncomfortable during most of the movie... Never loved a villain like this, in any movie. Bravo!!!"
178,"Todd Phillips and Joachin Phoenix have dug deep.. really deep, unearthing the first Joker character that is believable, not only in the comic book world, but in our world, the real world.

The acting from Phoenix is stunning, almost too good at times which make some scenes excruciating to watch. A man's mental stability and health spiralling uncontrollably without filter. The cinematography is also spectacular, influenced largely on Scorsese's Taxi Driver as are other elements of this movie.

There are also glaring similarities between this Joker and Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy, however De Niro's character study, in my opinion, is better, but only just.

Todd Philips' direction is well balanced and he guides us between tension and climax just right.

Overall, Joker is dark and not like any other comic book movie, which is truly a good thing."
179,I think it's an instant classic and its my favorite film of 2019
180,"Joker was epic. It's a fantastic character study centred around the most popular comic book villain of all-time but crafts a story that makes this incarnation of the character stand on its own. It's a beautifully crafted piece with stunning cinematography and art direction. I'm a fan of this changed appearance of the Joker. And Todd Phillips does a fantastic job in the director and writer's chair. Phillips' tackling of certain political and social issues will spark conversations in groups full of people smarter than myself, but I understood the messages that were coming across. But Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest draws of the film with such a praiseworthy performance. I don't really care for the Oscars and award shows anymore, but Phoenix deserves the accolades coming his way for such a masterful and haunting performance.

One thing that I must point out, is that it's unfair to compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. They may play the character with the same name, but these are two drastically different portrayals in both performance and script and it's unjust to compare. Just worship the fact that we were given two immense performances from two different actors."
181,"It was refreshing watching ""Joker"" in the theater (AMC Raceway, Westbury, NY). It was really nice watching a movie that took a new approach to (somewhat) familiar material. It was nice seeing a movie that challenges the audience. For the most part, ""Joker"" succeeds in what it was trying to do. Writer/ director Todd Phillips and company deserve a lot of credit. The best thing about this movie is its look. It really feels like that time and place. The problem that I had with ""Joker"" is that it seemed to wear out its welcome after a while. Joaquin Phoenix gives a good performance. But if I was supposed to somehow sympathize with his character's plight, I didn't. I didn't really care about him or any of the other characters for that matter. When you watch a movie and don't really care about the people you're watching you can start to lose interest. I didn't look at my watch during ""Joker"" but I was tempted. Dishonorable mention: a miscast Robert De Niro."
182,"Arthur Fleck is a clown living in Gotham City who isn't doing well. He is employed to hold an advertising banner outside a store but end up being beaten by a bunch of young thugs. His dream is of becoming a professional stand-up comedian. Whenever he gets stressed he can't help laughing. This leads to a confrontation on the subway which as fatal consequences for a trio of Wall Street types. Now the cops are looking for a killer clown. Some Gotham residents feel the victims got what they deserved leading to mayoral candidate billionaire Thomas Wayne describing the people of the city as clowns. Arthur's life becomes increasingly difficult; he learns his mother has been keeping secrets from him, cutbacks mean he loses his access to medication and talk show host Murray Franklin mocks a video of Arthur performing a stand-up routine on his show. It is only a matter of time before Arthur and the city lose control.

If you go into this hoping for a fun film with a comically villainous lead you are in for quite a shock. It may be centred on a famous DC comic creation but a few name changes would lead most viewers thinking this was completely unrelated to the world of Batman. The film has a very gritty feel. We may not be told when it is set but everything we see suggests that Gotham is '70s New York. From the use of the old Warner Brothers' logo to the graffiti covered subway train, cars, TVs, indoor smoking and general decor. Joaquin Phoenix is on top form as Fleck; reminding us of De Niro at his 'Taxi Driver' best... a film that clearly helped inspire this. Another clear inspiration is another De Niro film, 'The King of Comedy'... so much so that Robert De Niro himself plays Murray Franklin, he is on fine form here. There are no super-villains (or heroes) here, just a man who is becoming increasingly dangerous and out of control. There isn't a large amount of violence but what there is is brutal, shocking and feels very real. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a gritty character study; do not be put off if you aren't a fan of 'comic book films' as this is about as far from a typical example as it is possible to be."
183,"First and foremost, it looks gorgeous.

I love the gritty 70s New York City atmosphere: the run-down apartments; the dirty alleyways; the authentic-looking clothes; the tall, gothic buildings. Phenomenal.

But, ironically, it looks like any other comic book origin story: There's a miserable, aspiring comedian who is down on his luck. He gets picked on by everyone. He has problems with his mother, his boss, his coworkers, etc. His idol, a famous comedian and late show host, humiliates him on national television. And so on, and so on.

Maybe that's the point--or the joke--but it's still formulaic.

Joaquin Phoenix's acting was a bit awkward at times but still good. You can tell that he's really passionate about the roll, which is kind of rare these days. There's nothing to say about the other actors, since Phoenix's character is the main focus. They're all talented people who did their jobs.

A bit overated."
184,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ok, maybe not but they hype surrounding the movie killed it for me. It's not a masterpiece but an ok film. Why the one star? Way too many 10's! For once I actually agree with the actual critics who graded this film."
185,"You Asked for Joker...So here He is.

A Murderous Monster in Grease-Paint with an Uncontrollable Laugh and Psychosis.

This is the Story that Spawned Batman's Arch-Nemesis and the Pit of Hell where He came from.

You thought ""The Dark Knight"" was Dark...Get a Load of Joker.

Yes, it's a ""Modern"" Incarnation of Man's Dark Side and an Attempt to Explain what Caused this Unfortunate to become A Devil in Disguise.

The Film has All the Ingredients of the Macabre, Nightmarish, Horror and Mental Illness that make for a Disturbing Detour to the Mind of a Maniac and What Made Him.

Joaquin Phoenix Delivers an Unforgettable Portrayal of the ""Clown Prince of Crime"". In the Performance He Invokes Pathos and the Viewer does Feel the Pangs of Empathy.

Someone Said...""Hate the Sin...Love the Sinner"".

The Movie is the Darkest Comic-Book Movie Yet. It's Not Unprecedented in its Paper Origins. There have been Many a Dark Tales in the Batman Universe.

The Joker is a Murderer and Batman has Told Him that to His Grinning Face.

The Disturbing part here is that We Witness the Suffering and Abuse of the Character and Cannot be Unsympathetic.

Many Critics Hate this Unrelenting Trip to the Depths of Despair for Arthur, and seem Upset that the Film has the Audacity to Lay Bare a Soul of Constant Sorrow...

""I have never been happy one minute in my whole life""...Arthur Fleck/Joker

The Film is an Experience of an Existence of Extremes. It's an Ugly, Dirty Place Gotham. It Reeks of Garbage and is Inhabited by ""Super Rats"".

This is the Antithesis of a Marvel Movie and We Deserve it.

It's a Dual Universe."
186,"The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don't have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a ""good boy"". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker's life, I begin to get it."
188,JOKER is a masterpiece and that's all I have to say...
189,Thank goodness I didn't bring my little one with me. Me and my older kids enjoyed it. This movie is very dark and violent. One of the best prequels I have ever seen. Mr. Phoenix really deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker. This one of my top two movies this year. Almost two and a half hours long but worth it!
190,It Really Stands Out. It's Real Cinema. It's Art. It's Must Watch. 9/10.
191,"The Joker I knew was a very clever man but he is very naive here. We don't see him using his intelligence in the film. The events that made him ""The Joker we know"" didn't convince me enough. Maybe that's why I couldn't make contact.

His experiences in childhood. Rejecting by his father. Being raised by a mother with psychological problems. Yeah these are bad, it will ruin a person's life. But still he didn't experience events that could change his character that much. And turn him into ""Joker"".

But okay, I consider this normal. Because the joker isn't normal. If the system had given him what he wanted, he probably wouldn't have been The Joker. This is thought-provoking.

Which makes us think, is bad really bad? Or is it society that decides who is bad and who is good? Does society force us to be good or bad? Which is definitely what happens. We're not actually ourselves. We're just the people we're supposed to be. We are not us, we are them. If we're not who they want us to be, it's better for them that we don't exist at all.

Even though so many people are uncomfortable with the system. We can't easily turn into the Joker. System is equipped with the powerful tools to deter us and protect itself. In Joker's world, conditions are more favorable. Therefore, the situation seems consistent in itself.

The film talks about the awfulness of the society. But in doing so it uses superficial arguments that everyone is aware of already. This is still enough to mobilize people. Because, at the beginning of the film, the film already states that the situation in the city sucks. The Joker just pushes a little. Gravity takes care of the rest."
192,"When this film was announced, my initial thought was ""no one can come close to rivaling Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker in 'The Dark Knight'."" Let me tell you: Joaquin Phoenix give a phenomenal performance in ""Joker"" it'll be the biggest snub in Oscar history if he doesn't get nominated; he really dug deep for this one. As far as how it compares to Ledger's performance, it does, and it doesn't. It does because both will be talked about for years and will be considered some of the best performances in cinematic history that transcend any comic book movie portrayal by a long shot. Neither actor dialed in their performance; they each put the time and effort into making a unique interpretation of the character, which leads to the part where I mentioned that they don't compare because each version of the character are polar opposites of one another as far as their motives. Ledger's version was an agent of chaos; there was no reasoning behind his actions, he didn't have a clear backstory (it was multiple choice); he was just a guy that wanted to watch the world burn, and he portrayed that to perfection. Meanwhile, Phoenix's version, suffered from a mental illness all while being treated unfairly in life. We're taken through a series of tragic events through Arthur's perspective, that eventually push him over the edge and lead he to become the ""Clown Prince of Crime""; that was portrayed to perfection as well. Side Note: Robert De Niro was great too; even with the limited amount of screen time he had, he nailed the talk show host persona.

The film itself is a SLOW burn. It's more of a character driven film that takes it's time to show you everything that happens in the titular characters life, which leads up to a BRUTAL finale. It's because of amount of breathing room this film has, it won't be for everyone; if you're expecting the usual, run-of-the-mill comic book film with tons of fighting scene, guns and explosions, you'll walk out severely disappointed. This is more of a drama/character study that lets you into Arthur's mind but once the chaos starts...OH BOY!!!!.The movie was shot really well; Todd Phillips made some great choices in this film from a direction standpoint; the lighting, certain scene transitions, zoom in/out shots were all terrific. I wouldn't mind seeing Phillips tackle more films like this one. Overall, Phoenix's performance alone was worth the price of admission; he was THAT good; however, as I stated earlier, the film takes a long time to develop, which I usually don't mind because I'm a very patient movie watcher, but if there comes a time where I'm thinking: ""that's been established, we can move on"" that's when I know they're taking a little too long and unfortunately, I had that thought a few times throughout. The good thing is the ending is really good and really established how Gotham became the chaotic, crime-ridden city we all are accustomed to and it shows why Batman is needed..."
193,"Well played, well shot but one wonders why the movie theater is packed with Teens and Twens obviously enjoying the film. The plot stays within the usual boundaries: Villains have to have a condition to avoid that society (even the rich) is left with all the blame. I have seen worse films but I apart from some very intense camera work and acting, I left the movie with mixed feelings, mostly because I wonder what makes others rave about this story. With all the current anger and protests around the world, from the yellow jackets in France to the protesters in Hong Kong, Quito, Barcelona and Santiago de Chile one explanation might be that this plot about the origin of anger and aggression in a troubled looser who blames individuals, not the system, to be ignorant and deaf to his needs, apparently seems logical to a generation without other means to explain their personal anger."
194,"The one star only goes to reward the performance of the main actor. That's it! The rest of the movie is really just ... nah ... I really was expecting an amazing movie according to all the reviews ... but really, it - does - not - make - any - sense. What in this movie makes it so different that it deserves a 10? On average, users would review that a 6 or an 8 at max. So i wonder if there hasn't been a scam somewhere telling people: ""Put a ravishing review on Joker and you'll get an iPhone for free!"" The movie is very slow, very repetitive, not surprising, dragging, stupid (Joker seems to be 50 while Bruce is 10 ... So when Batman arrives, is he fighting a septuagenarian ???!!!) ... and dare i say, unoriginal ! All in all, boring!"
195,"W.O.W!!! What can I say about how brilliant Phoenix act performance is ?? In shortcut,movie of the year 💯/💯👏"
196,"Most movies that generate controversy come and go with little fanfare. Usually because they are not particularly good and therefore are tossed into the news cycle and disappeared abruptly and usually deservedly. There was that Seth Rogen movie about assassinating the Chinese dictator (never saw it), the 'Human Centipede' franchise that attempts to offend everybody (never will see it), and who can forget the conservative gasp over the American flag raising being left out of 'First Man' (saw it..meh). The problem with 'Joker' is it is good. No, it's great. And unless you are prepared to deal with the guilt, misplaced or otherwise, over your enjoyment of it, then you should skip it because Phoenix will seduced you with his performance. Is it wrong given the times we live in? Oh, yes. That's what makes it so amazing. It is impossible to dismiss the fact that this is simply a shockingly brilliant performance. And director Todd Philips offers up nothing to reassure the audience that this is ""just a movie"". There is no gimmick or troupe, ""super"" or otherwise, to remind us that this is a comic book universe. There is no room for Affleck's 'Batman' in this Gotham. It is deliberately as unpreposterous a world that appears to be, tragically, not much removed from our own. There are flaws to the film to be sure (DeNiro is distractingly miscast, and 'Thomas Wayne' is unsympathetically Trumpesque) and there is an argument to be made that we have seen this indepth character study in madness done before (check out Harry Treadaway in 'Mr. Mercedes'). None of that matters. Rest assured 'Joker' won't take home any Oscars. It's too sinister for the times we find ourselves in. As for Phoenix, his performance demands a whole new category that surpasses ""best actor"". But it will have to do."
198,"Went in the cinema to see a hyped up movie, left with an existential crisis. This is a brilliantly portrayed character that takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. The way the society has evolved in Gotham is not far from the society in any other big non-fictional city and this really makes me think about the future. ""Be kind, everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about."" *Oscar-worthy perfomance by Joaquin Phoenix."
199,"This movie is an intense dive into our dysfunctional societies that has taken a turn for the worse. To think the director behind such absurd film like Due Date and Hangover (Not that anything is wrong with those films) would even be willing to make this film in itself is amazing. Joker puts our ugly side under the spotlight and makes you wonder where does a society draw the line. Those that have watched the Swedish film The Square know that this is a concept that many film makers have worked on for so many years. Joker is just the darkest side of this story and question. this line the I am talking about is not the line of justifying the character of Joker but the line that eventually leads to making a person like Joker come to life. This movie constantly paints that picture, where is the line? Where do you put a stop to it? How could you have prevented this from happening? The movie opens with a clearly already broken man prisoner to the society and the system that is not willing or able to help him. Joker's situation is already beyond dire and further down the line you learn about all the happenings that lead to this broken man. The film maker and the actor never paint a heroic picture of Joker, he is not glorified by the movie. He is presented as the byproduct of a society that is eerily familiar. Because whether we like it or not we all are responsible for one another. We all affect each other's lives in ways that we can never imagine and psychological health is to this day a subject that is scoffed at even by the brightest and most free thinking people. No one likes to see where the monster comes from because we do not want to have the blaming finger turned on us. We just want the monster among us shunned, chained and caged and hanged. It is a fact that our failing societal relationships are leading to psychological illnesses and in extreme cases to violent outbursts. Most of these outbursts are introvert and almost nobody pays any attention to them but the extrovert ones are always scoffed at when doctors talk about the need to study and understand them. This is the world that creates Joker which is portrayed and criticized here. Leaving that subject behind lets talk about Joaquin Phoenix. This man is a wonder. I have followed his work through out the years watching him as he evolved with every movie he played and today when you watch Joaquin play Joker you see him through out his career. You see him in Gladiator, you see him in Ladder 49, you see him in Her. He has grown with every movie to the point where he creates this amazingly authentic performance for the audience to take part in. From the very first line, the mimicry, the slightest movement he is the character that he is portraying and he is Joker by the end of the movie. You can hear this pained and sick man, you can see his break point, you can feel his struggles and that makes this performance just exceptional. I am not going to even compare this performance, it really is an entirely different beast and by far one of the best performances I have seen in the recent years and easily the best Joker performance to this day. Lets go into the music...what can be said except intense? Something that I loved was the music choices, they really did convey the world's personality to me as audience. From the jazzy tones of the New York city life (as we know Gotham is basically New York and Chicago mixed into an unholy union) to the musics chosen to deliver the mood of the scene or character it felt really fitting and good. Then we come to the original sound track and we are basically dealing with a drama horror or thriller soundtrack with suspenseful moments and intense moments that makes you sit straight in wait for the impending explosion of events. This is Joker, every camera shot, every movement and every sound is there to make you wait for the right moment that it goes ""BANG"" and puts something new on your lap and this movie has several of those. This is Joker, a movie that studies what elements in a society can lead to the creation of people like Joker and Batman and in my humble opinion this movie delivered on this at every front possible. I wholeheartedly recommend watching this movie to anyone that is a fan of Cinema and good films in general."
200,"A real, raw and painfully guileless performance by Joaquin Phoenix contrasts with the captivating theatrics of Heath Ledger, and while the late actor achieved a beautiful onscreen presence, Phoenix delivers a new, memorably intimate take on the Joker.

The story itself detaches from the usual comic book shenanigans and takes a serious, melodramatic route, which pointedly negates the black-and-white nature of good and evil. It's always tricky to try to garner sympathy for a villain by drawing on the tragedies in their past, but I think Joker safely accomplishes this, leaving us all conflicted. Some questions are answered in ways that leave the viewer unsatisfied and suspicious - a clever tactic to make each of us decide who we choose to believe.

The direction and cinematography make this a captivating experience. Sudden events will elicit an awkward smile, while the rest is simply portentous and tragic."
202,"Joker is the latest iteration of the Clown Prince of Crime. After many different versions of the character, director Todd Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix give their film a sense of identity by taking after Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. They do this by making this version darker, and more realistic to even greater extremes. Joaquin Phoenix gives such a stellar performance, he'd make Heath Ledger proud. Joker hits, and hits hard. It works as a riveting character study, as well as an unnervingly realistic depiction of mental illness.

To say Joker is controversial is an understatement. The film deals with real world issues like mental illness, poverty, class wars, child abuse, antisocial behaviors, and anarchy. Many people will probably be put off with how disturbing the subject matter is. Others will see the film as glorifying antisocial behavior. Some will see it as mere entertainment. One thing that almost everyone can agree upon is this: this is one dark movie. Some people are afraid this film might incite real life violence. This film is similar to Fight Club, in regard that it comprises of crazy people doing anarchist things for the audience's amusement. Some people have valid concerns, however, Joker, although fictional, is a film that represents reality. There have been rebellions, and riots before, as well as class wars, and incidents incited by mentally disturbed individuals. Though the exact events of Joker have never happened in real life, they easily could. This film like most films should be left to viewers discretion. Art represents reality, and reality isn't always pretty.

Some people may also be turned off by Joker's realism. The main character Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), whose alter ego is the Joker, is a man down on his luck suffering from a mental illness. This movie doesn't hold back by showing mental illness in all its ugliness. Crazy people have graced the screen before, but real life crazy is not glamorous in the slightest sense. You couldn't help but feel unnerved and disturbed by the sheer ugliness of this crazy crime-ridden, messed-up take on Gotham city. The world is so dark, apathetic, and brutal. The streets are littered with rats and other filth, government programs get shut down do to a lack of funding, and depressing scenery of busy toxic city life cram the screen. One can't blame Arthur for losing his mind.

Something the film excelled at was getting the audience to empathize or feel bad for Arthur, aka The Joker. His life and the world around him is so soul-crushingly harsh. When the film starts out, he is not that bad of a guy. He cares for his ailing mother, works unfulfilling jobs, and fights his mental illness. The society crumbling around him creates the Joker. It's very realistic to see Joker unintentionally and indirectly starting all this mayhem and anarchy. He is just the straw that broke the camel's back. Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker extremely well. He is more of a mentally ill man wearing clown makeup than a larger-than-life supervillain. Joaquin plays the character in the shadow of Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, except Joaquin's character is even more socially isolated and disturbed.

Joker is heavily influenced by Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy - two films that star Robert De Niro. Both of Scorsese's films deal with a mentally unhinged loner acting out against society in violent or antisocial ways. Joker tries to be a combination of the two films while molding itself into Batman lore. Joker successfully weaves its influences together without being derivative. If there are any criticisms, they are all minor - typical movie sins you find in most movies. To name a few, how does Arthur sneak a gun onto a Talk Show and how does he sneak into the Wayne theater so easily. Criticisms apart, along with two great Scorsese films, Joker stays with you with its compelling performances, disturbing subject matter, and shocking moments. Joker gets under your skin and lingers there."
203,"Joaquin Phoenix absolutely killed the movie (no pun intended) with his fantastic performance as Joker. The movie was beautiful and was smartly shot, if you're a person who notices small details like me, you'll be amazed by the details that were presented, like the colour scale in each scene as there was a specific pattern in that. The build-up in the background music also hinted how the character was developing until it reached the ""max level"" let us say. Even the scenes that were supposedly real, but turn out to be only a hallucination inside the mind of Arthur (Joker). Moreover, despite what some people didn't like this movie just because it was too violent and showed that it was praising the evil and violence, while the real message is actual and should be taken seriously as we witness it from time to time, especially in school mass shootings. People don't end up killing the other all of a sudden, it is all built up from continuous bullying and getting abused, and when those people seek for help in mental health services lets say, they should really help them not just listening to them, asking the same questions over and over then give them medication which can get them addicted at some point."
204,"Story of corruption and mental illness , day dream your life away because your life is not going the way you want it to be. This movie has amazing cinematography , not great of punch lines , more sarcastic then scary which I preferred the opposite. Great acting form Joaquin I can't think of someone else now days to be a joker better than him.Good movie not that great. no scene or a line stuck in mind. Not a ""masterpiece""."
206,"After Heath Ledger's version of the Joker in the hugely popular Christopher Nolan Batman movies it was difficult to see how Joker could be a success.

But quite simply this is one of the best films I've ever seen.

I've loved many of Todd Phillips' comedies such as Road Trip, Old School and The Hangover, but I would have never thought he was capable of writing and directing a movie like Joker.

It's pretty uncomfortable viewing for the most part. It's almost like a documentary following someone's mental health journey as they spiral into depression and a life of crime.

The script, music and cinematography are all incredible and Joaquin Phoenix is one of the most deserved Oscar winners I've ever seen. He's an incredible actor. Truly mesmerising.

Robert De Niro also deserves a special mention for one of his best performances for a long time.

If you haven't seen this movie you have to watch it! It doesn't matter if you're not a Batman or comic book fan as it also holds up as a standalone movie.

I hope Todd Phillips continues on this path and look forward to his next movie."
207,"I will start off by saying this review will be spoiler free, as well as a minor disclaimer for those thinking about seeing Todd Phillip's Joker.

If you are expecting your typical, over-done, run of the mill comic book movie. You won't find that here. This is not a film filled with jokes that either work or don't work; this isn't a movie where the heroes always win. This is a movie centered around a troubled man and his descent into madness.

It is dark and, at times, horrifying. And it is an outstanding masterpiece because of that. Had this movie been toned down, it would not have been nearly as great as it is.

Joker is centered around a failed, mentally-troubled comedian called Arthur Fleck. He is constantly looked down upon by society, beaten and bullied. And, as you may have guessed, this causes him to slowly lose his mind and become the Joker. That's not a spoiler, by the way. If you think that's a spoiler, look at the name and synopsis of the movie.

It's filled with shocking, gruesome scenes. Tense encounters. A realistic depiction of how it is to lose sanity. And it is absolutely terrifying. A once innocent man trying to chase his dream like so many of us is beaten and bullied, or often ignored by society when it matters, becomes ones of the most notorious criminals in all of comic book history.

Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar-Worthy performance that rivals that of Heath Ledger. And at times? It trumps Heath Ledger's Joker. It is crazy and sadistic and, at times, honestly haunting. Terrifying, even. The writing is absolutely incredible in this movie and complements Joaquin's acting abilities. I don't think there could have been anyone better to star in this movie than him.

Acting his fantastic across the board. But this review would be incredibly long if I wrote as much about them as I have Phoenix. But everyone, from top to bottom, contributed to this masterpiece extremely well.

If you've not seen it already, go see it! Just do not expect this to be like anything else you have seen. It's dark, twisted and haunting. It's not a happy-go-lucky, joke filled superhero flick.

10/10"
208,"Little to say. I expected a masterpiece of a movie only based on comic books, and concentrated only in a character study for the ages.

It is.

Perfect story. Twists. Real drama. Real pain. Darkly funny at times, but not comedic in the least. It is violent, as it should, but never glorifying violence like the rest of the comic book adaptations (even the ones I love like Man of Steel or Infinity War or...)

It is just perfect. I give my ""Thanks"" to all the people involved (I gave my money too, which is more important to them).

----------- As a negative, It's not particularly original, with too many things (a few times, scenes) from King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It is clearly better than those movies though"
209,"I want to start this review by saying i have been an avid marvel movie fan and for many years was embarrassed for DC in their attempts to catch up in the game. However, this film flipped the entire script! Marvel found a very good formula through directors such as the Russo brothers and writers such as Taika Waititi in which they combined elements of action, comedy and story to produce some very enjoyable films. Todd Phillips' take on Joker did everything right that DC films had been missing and then some. This film is not meant to give you that nice, warm feeling you feel walking out of a marvel film but to challenge your perception of society and the issues within it. It achieves this in waves and has allowed DC to achieve something marvel have lacked by suggesting the world we live in sometimes isn't worth protecting as it is. Joaquin Phoenix is of course exceptional in the role and approaches the role from a real understanding of what it entails. See this film and try not to feel anything, I dare you!"
210,"This movie is about the origin story of Joker. Arthur Fleck, a poor fellow, who is abandoned by the society, chooses the path of destruction and becomes JOKER.

This movie is Dark and Dramatic.

Joaquin Phoenix has poured his heart out to live up the character of the joker. Todd Phillips has also done great work in directing the movie.

This movie doesn't leaves any loop-hole and very well connects to the Batman story. I liked the Plot of this movie. It is realistic and stick to the ground.

A Worthy Watch."
211,"Joaquin Phoenix did an incredible job playing Arthur Fleck who really seems like someone who's sick in the head, but not in a bad way for some reason. He just looks like a really troubled guy who needs some assistance. His home life wasn't the greatest and he grew up with a very deranged mother, i think that's the reason why he is the way he is. People treat him like garbage and it just rubbed him the wrong way. Cinematography was great. Acting was perfection. 10/10 would recommend."
212,"Oscar bait with a try-hard message that is obvious at any point. The acting is good but nowhere near perfection. The camera work is good but shows nothing new, the same goes to everything else. It's ok at best so I'd give it a 4-5 but since everyone treats it as a masterpiece, so will I. Compared to Pulp Fiction, Eraserhead, The Audition, Dances with Wolves, Lone Wolf and Cub, The Dark Knight, Alien etc it's a shaky 2 at best...sorry If you break it down it's a crazy guy dancing and making funny faces while the message is slapping you in the face. Nothing artsy about this piece of mainstream cinema."
213,I did not know what to expect from this film. After viewing it the film was just alright. It was nothing phenomenal that blew me away. Phoenix does great job in the unsettling role. He embodies the Joker and adds his touches. I felt like some parts dragged on a bit. After a while I just started wondering when will he become the Joker.
214,"I am just amazed at how this only 69% of critics liked it, but it has a 9.0 here! I admit that it's not as good as Heath Ledger's Joker, but it's still awesome. The funny thing is that there's a good reason why the movie isn't called ""THE Joker"". The creators said that the Joker might just be a persona various people took. Batman does in fact appear in this, but only as a small child. He's worked very well into the plot.

I could really associate with what Joker was going through. He had been taking all these medicines yet none of them worked. He was angry at the rich for oppressing the poor. Him killing rich people at first really does inspire people. It really was a great study on the status of the richest and treats the story as very mundane. That was kind of already done in ""The Dark Knight"", but the focus is done so well here too. ***1/2"
215,"I have to say that I'm a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix and I can say that he really nailed it while playing Joker. Movie, itself, is very emotional, but for my taste, a bit to slow. The drama kicks in at times, but it feels like the movie is lacking something. Maybe it's my subjective point of view, since most people like to say that it's the best movie of 2019, but I think it's a bit exaggerated. Still, I think it's worth to see it. The movie has great cinematography, plot is great, acting from De Niro is also worth mentioning, the score and the screenplay are great, too, still I think I seen better movies last year :)"
216,"Honestly people who have rated this movie as a ""masterpiece"" need to start watching some actual masterpieces. Predictable over indulgent and simplistic (not in a good way). You could see every ""climax"" 10 mins before it happens. Good things and why I have it 4. 1.Score 2.Cinematography 3.Art direction 4.Music choice

Film makers need to start making some good films!"
217,"If you didn't feel his pain, you have no soul. Amazing acting by Joaquin Phoenix."
218,"Joker is yet another comic book cinematic masterpiece from DC, a rare jem which seamlessly combines a villain origin story with an enthralling and somewhat nuanced look at mental breakdown and working class living. The most dramatic scenes will leave you (in my case, literally) on the edge of your seat, with Phoenix's performance and Phillip's direction being an absolute recipe for success. An instant classic for comic book fans and human drama fanatics alike, with a fantastic 70s aesthetic, asserting again the ""true"" golden age of the cinema and of urban realist filmmaking, in a new context. Loved it! A must-watch!"
219,"Wow. This film is more realistic than any other comic book character, ever. Joaquin Phoenix will finally get his Oscar, as will Todd Phillips for bringing his brilliant vision to life. This film is perfection in every aspect, although I would've liked the pace a little faster with about 10 min of 122 min runtime trimmed down. Still, wow. 9/10 from me."
220,"Joaquin Phoenix has done a brilliant job in the movie and you get carried away with this character, his philosophy so much so that you think he is right everytime. That's when you have impressed as an actor. Was truly lucky to catch this one in the theatres."
221,"The ultimate goal of the film is to make you uncomfortable. Does it succeed? It really does. This movie isn't for everyone, but it's a very unique and well-done film with top notch acting."
222,"This movie gave an insight to the picture of mental illness and how consuming it is. If people want to say this movie is ""dark"" it's the picture of that real disease. For me this movie was a true pleasure, Joaquin absolutely poured all of his talent into his role. His portrayal brought to light the real reason The Joker became such the character. His performance alone made this a must see if you are a fan of Batman."
223,"This movie's tone is dark, chilling, haunting, violent and at times actually funny. I thought overall this movie could have been better, but it's still a good movie. It kind of starts slow, but as it goes on it gets better and the ending is the best part of the movie. Heath Ledger is still my favorite Joker, but Joaquin Phoenix is still great with his own interpretation of Joker. I personally would love to see a sequel that has Joker taking on Batman. Also be aware that this is not your typical supervillain origin story. This is a psychological drama that explains the origin of Joker and focuses more on story and character development than on action and special effects. This movie reminds me a lot of Taxi Driver, which Robert De Niro was also in."
224,The best movie of the year Every one needs to watch it
225,"Not sure what others see in this movie. J. Phoenix delivers an amazing performance, yes, but that's basically all this movie has going for it. Ok, the cinematography is good and production values are high. But apart from this, the plot is boring and the references to Batman's universe feel forced. I watch the movie and only see a mentally unstable and sick man getting worse and worse, with a background of social unrest in the city. Also, the Joker was a cunning and cruel villain, so I don't think it's a good choice to make him start as a failed sad clown, where is the intelligence, the ambition? I don't think the clown is the core of this character, but rather a chosen aesthetic that has certain meaning. In summary, I find a disconnection between the character of the Joker in Batman and this guy that we see turning crazy here."
226,"Not sure what kind of message this movie is supposed to send. Or is it supposed to be just fun, because it's not. I don't sympathize with the main character at all, throughout the whole movie he would get on my nerves. I was waiting entire time for the plot to start revolving and when it finally did, the movie was over and left me with a feeling that I've waisted two hours of my life on nothing. For a movie with this high rating I expected to see something fresh and inspirational and somehow it seems to me all the scenes and acting I've seen in this movie I saw a thousand times in bunch of other movies, like it was cliche after cliche. Yawn festival."
227,"Joaquin Phoenix Is simply outstanding! One of the best films I've seen for years.. just absolutely loved it!!

And the Oscar goes to..."
228,"This movie was made by expert psychologists! This movie is far beyond filmography.

I also think main actor should get enough money to take a long, long pause from movie making. Pure 10... 11!"
229,"An anarchist, his falling apart life and a city on edge -- what else you need to make a gritty, dark and violent biography of one of the greatest villain of cinematic history.

Todd Phillip's Joker ticks all the box when it comes to making an edgy and dark film like this. Splashing blood, outrageous deaths and a world which is crumbling apart. This film has everything. But the soul of this film is Joker himself. This rendition of Joker, very skillfully takes inspiration from all the past presentations and yet able to put a breath of fresh air on this legendary character.

Joaquin Phoenix's performance is not just breathtaking but strangely satisfying. Playing Joker on screen is perhaps one of the toughest jobs an actor can have. People have high hopes. And after Ledger's performance, Phoenix had a big shoe to fill in. But he shines in this film. The ease with which Phoenix carries out the role, speaks volume about his acting callibre.

About the other aspects of the film, the cinematography is on point. It very craftily captures the city from Joker's eyes. It shows his struggle and his making. The audience was very much used to watching Gotham from Batman's eyes, but perhaps for the first time, we as an audience has access to the other side of the narrative.

Speaking of the other side, this film very successfully shows the class struggle we humans have to endure. Moreover it shows the cycle of hate and crime, which effects the Gotham City and also eventually the life of our own Bruce Wayne.

This film is a must watch. Although it might not be the best DC film ever to come, but it certainly is a living tribute to probably the greatest and most nuanced character humans have ever created."
230,"Read all you like about ""Joker"" - there is nothing that will prepare you for the gut-punch to come. This is less ""The Dark Knight"" and more ""Taxi Driver"" but make no mistake, it feels like the most original take you have ever seen on a well-worn genre. It is an uber-violent character study of a mentally ill man trying to survive in a bleak society that is failing him. It is an immersive and cathartic experience, and an enthralling and uncomfortable one for the viewer.

If there is a more perfect performance than Joaquin Phoenix commands in this film, I would love to debate it. His depth and range is an acting masterclass and somehow demands empathy in a violent and disturbed character.

Todd Phillips stamps himself as a modern master with this film. The look and feel of the film has such pace and menace, yet at the same time creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.

It is a brilliant film. I hope people continue to see it as a cinematic masterpiece and it doesn't get caught up in politics or become part of a narrative of the sometimes flawed society we live in ourselves."
231,"I haven't been this obsessed with a movie since I saw Taxi Driver 30 years ago...and my obsession for Joker surpasses it in spades. Everyone else has said all there is to say, I can't really add to it other than to say it almost feels pointless to go to the movies after seeing this because it's impossible for anything to compare. I can't explain why it's so good, you just have to see it. The directing, cinematography, music, screenplay, and of course the jaw dropping acting....everything about it is flawless. The timing of the film is uncomfortable, yes, but I think it's needed. Joker doesn't teach us to be violent. It teaches us to STOP BEING SUCH ***HOLES TO EACH OTHER.

I understand that not everyone will connect with this film or ""get it"". And you're not supposed to. This is a film for those who relate to it in some way and not everyone will. But if you do, if you get it, you won't ever see a more remarkable and all consuming film. It's truly astonishing filmmaking.

And if it doesn't sweep every category at the Oscars because of controversy then shame on the Academy and shame on everyone voting."
232,Joker lulls and meanders in certain parts but overall it is a masterpiece. It serves as an all too real portrayal of the gutter of unchecked capitalism. This is riveting fiction but a haunting reflection of reality - a comic book movie only by association.
233,"The acting was totally impeccable. But the movie, It did not keep me interested the whole time. On my opinion it was just a movie played by some terrific actors."
234,"It's hard to watch at times, yet you can't look away. Phoenix is compelling in this role, and because of the types of roles he selects (dark characters), I doubt he will ever get the credit he deserves. I've reached the point where if Joaquin is in it, I'm watching.

DeNiro on the other hand, is mailing it in as is his current style. That he plays a dopey game show host is somewhat fitting. If you know who Joe Franklin was, it is a pretty accurate portrayal, but sadly, Bobby has become a parody.

You know what's coming, but not how its coming. I was very sympathetic to his character. He was a loner, subjected to lots of emotional abuse. Its really amazing, but it's not for everybody."
235,"As films go it is ok, it is not a super villain movie so do not go expecting so. It's basically a film about mental health and one man's downward spiral into a very dark place. I feel we are suffering from a case of the Emperors new clothes unfortunately."
237,"Overall Great movie!!! (writing, direction, acting) I am excited to see if it's strength raises the bar for newer releases. It's plot sings the blues of the jokers story and does so with nostalgic aesthetics- combining ""Taxi driver"" psycology with a ""King of Comedy"" theme (Coincidently two movies starring De Niro & directed by Scorsese). The emphasis was heavy on the mental illness and misfortunes of Arthur Fleck but unexplored were the entertaining/ musicality traits of a joker. The playfulness that was expressed through the character seemed more-so of Joaquin Phoenix and less in the spirit of Joker. Throughout the movie the Joker is portrayed as self conscious and the resolution/ climaxed rebellion is an out-cry from that- not so much on his real connection to Gotham or a villainous reign. That said I don't see this Joker bright enough to be an infamous, self sustaining, street-wise villain."
238,I'm blown away by Joaquin Phoenix's performance. He totally inhabits the persona . I couldn't tear my eyes away. Mesmerising. That dance on the steps surely must go down as one of the most iconic scenes ever and using Gary Glitters music subversive. The movie is absorbing and disturbing. The violence makes an impact would being too gory. You could read a lot of symbolism into the the movie. A parable of our times? I just let it wash over and immerse me. Highly recommended!
239,This is one of the best movies of this year. And i really expect it to be nominated for an oscar. It's not related to DCEU . And it was beyond my expectations.
241,"There are tons of reviews focusing on the extraordinary acting of Joaquin Phoenix, so I am skipping that part. I would like to make comments on the heated discussion that whether this movie glorifies the violence.

Right off the ""bat"", I think it doesn't. Joker beautifully portrays how villains/monsters emerge and rise to power in a society.

The dominant Western culture dictates that being good or bad is a completely personal choice and no society should be blamed for the rotten apples among them. On the other hand, leftist approaches tend to put the blame on the socio-economical structures of a society and they claim that the system produces such abnormalities.

This fine piece of art takes a balanced attitude that blends the two extreme wiews summarized above. Arthur was a mentally disturbed person long before emerging as the Joker. He was delusional, depressed, and he had many social anxieties to prevent him of being a functioning member of a society. So, why did he become a villain, among many other troubled people? Because the society he lives in was corrupted and it was causing unrest. Ordinary people were already looking for an icon to channel their rages and discontent towards.

So, for a true villain to rise, there must be a perfect combination of personal and sociological conditions. In the absence of psychological troubles, the villain candidate can't go the extra mile and endure such a depraving journey. On the other hand, in the absence of a truly corrupt and disgusting societal background, actions of a villain candidate would be considered unnecessary violent acts and as a result, the masses would not approve him/her. This is one of the main reasons why the people don't embrace lone wolf attacks nowadays. Despite all the problems they have, societies don't need a villain and that's why the villain candidates are mostly labelled as the depraved crazies.

To wrap it up, the movie doesn't glorify the violence at all. It demonstrates the psychological and sociological conditions of a villain emerging and being widely accepted by an imaginary society. Actually, it's a free lesson for the policymakers all around the world. If you invest on the mental health of individuals and rule them fairly, the Joker can't be around."
242,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
243,"Very good acting performance - but the movie itself left a lot to be desired. How to make a 2 hour movie all about one role/actor? Dont. There was so much attention paid to the Joker role that all the other participants in the movie were overlooked and it left the movie shallow and devoid of depth. It was obvious from early on what was going on and I was thinking ""I can see where this is going"" and I was right. It was like going to see Laurence Olivier in Richard 3rd on the stage - you know exactly what you are going to get - it is all about his performance. But IMO a movie that attempts such a feat will always fall flat - because the 'feel' between stage and film as so vastly different. To all the millenials today - if you liked the acting performance in this movie go watch a good Broadway stage play - get over the comic movies and learn how to live."
244,"Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down."
245,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance is excellent, but the film is flawed, the main offenders being a second act twist that's visible a mile away and a small scene during the ending that feels tacked on.

However, you should see this film at least once."
246,"A deep scan of reviews has fans that can understand depression become overwhelmed with empathy. There is a reason for everything, and understanding the context of a nostalgic character like the joker is what works.

There was not a faithfulness to the scenes in Batman begins. Police chief introduces him during the outro as someone fairly unknown not a state wide celeb as played out in this film, that break in story continuity ruins it for me.

Likewise the reinterpretation of Mr Wayne as something he never was. This takes away from the moral clarity of the pending superhero Batman.

The greed narrative feels like its something that was force fed without rhyme or reason. While the joker had a substantial arc, the sub plots did not.

Nostalgia is what brings the film to life, there is not many ways to not make money from iconic characters, this film should have been attempted years ago!

Over the years Hollywood actors have been applauded for playing villians which is the easiest character study of them all. Whats hard is being protector of the realm without it feeling preachy or cheesy. These roles get a natural upscaling.

The main plot element of inviting Arthur onto the talk show was not convincing, the stand up performance was not in the genre of 'so bad its good' his first vision from the audience defending his mother was however powerful and well written.

A cameo for Alfred the butler would have been special and really pulled us back into the story.

The ways this film was lauded in its first week was ridiculous, it does drag in many places over the 2hr hour screening.

All the theatrical trailers were an 8 so many of us expected more. To say this is a better production than Batman Begins is shocking.

The difficult reality to bare in this over hyped rating and cultural reality is many people in our age really feel like this and are on the verge of rioting after life takes its toll.

The broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes is a great story that can be told a million ways, this was not executed well.

The dream sequences worked well but the device was still not as good as Heath Ledgers raw portrayal of a psychopathic megalomaniac and the cinematography of Nolan in related films.

Simple plot failures like the police not being able to catch up with Arthur who was not trying to be careful was disappointing and took me right out of the story.

A good ensemble of actors can't save a bad script, why was this rushed to production? Something as important as Batman origin stories need much more careful work. I believe over time this score must average out and down.

Was this an homage to ""Taxi Driver"" or ""The King of Comedy"" apparently not. The opportunity for genuine franchise building was surprisingly tossed away and will be hard to repair.

Critics who use the word 'masterpiece' and 'groundbreaking' need to have a long hard look at themselves, their surroundings and the education that they all seem to share. There is F all diversity in this mob who keep playing us."
247,"I had avoided all the trailers and press on this film and in all honestly, didn't expect much from it. DC films haven't been the greatest over the past lot of years and here we are again with WB trying to go down another route to try and make something of it...

Well - I'm only glad they did.

Joker is quite simply one of the finest pieces of film I have seen in a long time - especially from Hollywood, which isn't too often. From Joaquin's incredible performance (just amazing), to the stunning cinematography and score, I just can't think of a single moment that lost me.

Well done Todd Phillips and team, and well done Joaquin for the greatest performance of the Joker ever!"
248,The story was interesting and well written. Joaquin's performance and scenography was brilliant. It was an emotional rollercoaster. One of the best character developments I have ever seen. You even feel sorry for the character even though he is killing people.
249,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, the use of color and the story were seamless"
250,"If you're on the fence like I was thinking it was hype and almost didn't watch it, you must!

Dark knight doesn't even compare and the way it's tied into the beginning of Batman is amazing!

Hands down the best movie in the Batman universe ever made, hoping for more from this director."
251,"I really liked this film. Like its one of the most beautiful tragedy films i have every seen. But I watched it with my friends and they didn't like it. So if you like slow, tragedy and good acting films. Go for it."
252,It's not possible to say everything about this masterpiece. But i can say this and insure you that It's not only about the time you spent in the theatre but also time you will keep thinking about this movie even after you walks out.
253,"JOKER is astounding and confrontational. It covers issues like mental illness, class warfare, guns, societal breakdown, etc., while presenting a ""villain"" in Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who is as sympathetic as he is terrifying. Filled with uncomfortable, even shocking moments, as well as unsettling comedic elements, some scenes will make many viewers squirm!

Arthur is the overlooked, dismissed ""nobody"", forced to believe he doesn't even exist. He's a man in desperate need of help. Unfortunately, Gotham city isn't the place to find it. As his mind begins to shatter, Arthur has no idea what's coming his way. He simply finds his strength in a sudden act of violence, and somehow taps into the void within those around him, ultimately becoming a sort of messiah.

The mesmerizing Mr. Phoenix uses his body as much as his dialogue to bring both Arthur and his alter ego to life. This is a movie to be watched and taken seriously, in spite of its comic book origins. It's as much a serious statement as it is entertainment. Multiple viewings recommended..."
254,"It is whatever you want it to be. If you want to hate it, you'll hate it. If you want to love it, you'll love it. Be optimistic."
255,"I'm not a big fan of comic books, as the matter of fact I never read one and I usually don't care about movies based on them, Batman, Spiderman, Captain America, Marvel, DC, whatever... I'm a sucker for psychology movies and that's why I watched this one. And oh boy was it a good decision! If you're expecting your typical comic book-y Joker vs Batman, good vs evil kind of thing you will be disappointed. This is a study of REAL human madness, it's a critic of modern society, it's as real as it gets. Joker is a flawless movie, by far the greatest masterpiece of 21st century, and I am expecting at least one Oscar. And if it gets a sequel as good as this, that sequel deserves Oscar too. I've already seen it twice and I think I didn't have enough of it so I'll watch again"
257,"This film tries desperately to devillify the most stylish and charismatic villain in the DC universe and excruciatingly transform him into a poster child for mental illness in the most tedious manner possible.. This version of the Joker lacks any semblance of style, luster, flair, or charisma, leaving me to wonder why anyone would bother investing the time and money required to create this turkey, much less watch it.

They've murdered the Joker for the sake of some social commentary and PC promotion. I don't deny that mental illness is a real issue or that attention should be brought to it, but folks watch movies about supervillians to see super-villainy, not a 2 hour public service announcement. I hung in there as long as I could hoping for this movie to redeem itself, but about 3 quarters of the way through I could take no more of watching it spin it's wheels.

If you are a fan of the Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger versions of the Joker then you will likely find this film as painful to watch as I did."
258,"As an DC fanboy lost hope on DC when they made JL, but i eventually started going back to the cinemas after Wonderwomen and Aquaman. When The Joker film was announced as Joaquin pheonix in the lead i must say i had my doubts. I was pretty sure noone could even match Heath ledger's Joker.. I was wrong. This might be the best DC film ever made! Joaquin pheonix did the impossible. Mindblowing performance as the joker! The best after Heath Ledger! Movie of the year! The laughs, screams, craziness and the dark psychological sufferings of the Joker will haunt you for the rest of the year. I must say The Joker is back! Trust me on this! 9/10 on this one!

P.S This is my second 9/10 for a DC movie after TDK."
259,"Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the ""Clown Prince of Crime"" as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only ""Joker"". And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's ""Joker"" was like that of the late 70's early 80's ""Joker"" in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.

Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a ""Golden Globe"" or ""Oscar"") a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.

However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.

Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to ""The Dark Knight"". Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.

Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates ""The Joker""(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!) As Joaquin's performance was raw, gritty, and a lashing out of some payback to society. Wow enough said best D.C. comics character study ever made!"
260,"""Joker"" Review (9.5/10)

I was close to giving this movie a ten out of ten, but then I thought to myself is it wrong for me to think that Joker is brilliant and unsettling all in one? Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have not just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history, but reimagined the comic book movie itself. ""I just don't want to feel so bad anymore,"" whispers Arthur, who's also on seven different types of medication and has been in the system for most of his life. A system that now has no resources or time for him. A desperate whisper that you know won't be heard by anyone. That simply signifies the beginning of both a descent and his path to becoming the Joker. This is ultimately what Joker is: an origin story. One that touches only ever so lightly on what has come before in the DC Universe. This could, particularly in the current climate, be viewed as a lament for outsiders and the ignored. That's too simple and Joker does anything but deliver you easy answers. It's a sad, chaotic, slow-burn study of someone who isn't visible; who doesn't even exist to the world around them. But your empathy, sympathy even, isn't guaranteed, and it begins to dissolve as Arthur somehow moves even further to the edges. This is, we mustn't forget, the story of how a villain was made. As Arthur/Joker, Joaquin Phoenix is astonishing. Phillips has said he had a picture of the actor above his screen when writing the script and it's a belief that has paid off. Phoenix inhabits Arthur: having lost weight for the role, he looks thin, frail, hungry. Shadows carve out his exposed bones. His physicality is precise, the way he moves, shuffles, runs, sits, smokes, shrinks. His usual intensity is on full display and it's captivating, even overwhelming in moments. While this is Phoenix's film, Frances Conroy is quietly devastating as Arthur's mother Penny, and Zazie Beetz, as neighbour Sophie Dumond, while arguably underused, brings vital humanity to her scenes with Arthur. The most talked-about piece of casting was obviously Robert De Niro as late-night TV host Murray Franklin. Mention must be made of Joker's cello score by Hildur Guðnadóttir: mournful, dark and fractured, and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher. In his hands, Gotham is alive as a flawed, brutal, broken-hearted character in its own right. Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
262,"Truly a masterpiece of filmmaking. I would without a doubt argue that Joaquin Phoenix holds one of the best performances of all time, this may even be the best performance I've ever witnessed in cinema. Truly truly a masterwork. People say it's violent but the world is violent, just most people who can afford to go to the movies are lucky enough that their bubble keeps the darker parts of the world out, but how long can we stay at such peace? Is the peace we hold real in the grand scheme of things? Or are we just fooling ourselves?"
264,"Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come. Clearly drawing its spirit and style from classic '70s and '80s films like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, A Clockwork Orange, and Dog Day Afternoon, director Todd Phillips' Joker presents a Gotham City that is unmistakably a stand-in for the hellish New York City of the era. It was a time when rampant crime, corruption, economic crises, and social ills saw it dubbed ""Fear City.""

This Gotham is a place of grimy despair, extreme wealth disparity, and festering lawlessness, teetering on the brink of collapse. While this realistic depiction makes a place that's typically fantastical seem familiar, it's not just the recognizable setting that gives Joker its hyper-realism; it's what it's allegorically about that makes the movie so believable, timely, and worth talking about long after the credits roll. Joker is a period piece but it is undeniably about our own troubled, relentlessly violent time.

Joker's setting (roughly 1981) not only allows the film to be a comic book version of classic Martin Scorsese or Sidney Lumet films, it also strips away the technology that nowadays would help catch such a madman sooner rather than later. This is a time when people smoked everywhere (including hospitals), security cameras and metal detectors weren't ubiquitous, and no one wore seat belts while driving. Times were bad but they could get even worse. Joker the character acts as the symbolic match to that waiting dynamite.

Unnervingly played by Joaquin Phoenix, the mentally ill Arthur Fleck is a struggling, overlooked schlepp trapped on the margins of society. Arthur is a man who has never had a good break or happy day in his life. The less said about how and why Arthur embraces the Joker persona and finds his liberation and joyful empowerment the better - this is a film meant to be experienced with an open mind and sans spoilers - but suffice it to say this Joker is the end result of a society far too comfortable with its casual cruelties and lack of empathy. We create the monsters we deserve.

Joker is an indictment of a society's collective disregard for the well-being of its citizens rather than necessarily critiquing any one type of individual or class. As much as you sympathize with their plight, Gotham's downtrodden can be as callous and vicious as the rich and powerful. Arthur is at one point or another injured emotionally or physically by individuals at every level, as well as by the institutions they populate. If Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle called himself ""God's lonely man"" then Arthur Fleck is certainly Gotham's lonely man. Arthur is ultimately seeking human connection, something he tragically won't find until he puts on a happy face and violently exposes the city's own hypocrisies and inhumanity.

Joker the film may ask viewers to empathize with its central protagonist but it doesn't ask us to forgive him for his increasingly evil choices. As many real-world parallels and inspirations can be uncomfortably drawn from Arthur's descent into violent madness, the film still knows he's deranged and not to be romanticized - merely understood.

The key to that careful calibration is not only Todd Phillips' sharp direction and clear vision but also Joaquin Phoenix's indelible performance. Arthur's uncontrollable laughter looks as though it physically pains him; his body is rail-thin and battered, his misery is etched on his deeply creased face. He looks healthier and livelier -- dare I say happier -- as he transforms into Joker than he ever does as Arthur. Phoenix captures all these tiny nuances in Arthur and his interactions with others that reveal so much about this disturbed individual's inner life.

The camerawork is often claustrophobically tight on Phoenix, who's in nearly every scene, all of which adds to the film never making me feel like I was anywhere but in Arthur's tortured headspace. As solid as Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy are in their small roles here, this is Phoenix's film and he delivers a tour de force.

Considering the comic book Joker infamously once said he preferred his origin to be multiple choice, this movie wisely embraces the ambiguity of its title character, despite this seemingly being an origin story. Arthur's increasingly unstable mental state is reflected in the film as things grow progressively more dreamlike -- okay, nightmarish -- and violent in the homestretch.

Phillips (along with co-screenwriter Scott Silver) designed a film that demands multiple viewings; one of Joker's strengths is that anyone will be able to argue their side about what was real and what was imagined, and no one will be able to say another's read of it is inaccurate. For a movie about one of fiction's most unreliable narrators, we should expect nothing less.

Verdict

Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
266,"Watched this film after hearing how great it was, but also aware it was a controversial film. Simply put - this is a marvellous film, you don't need to read any of the reviews i have watched it twice already and I'll most likely watch it again.

To my mind - it's a Masterpiece. I have the feeling this film will be talked about for a long time."
267,"There is no doubt in my mind that Joaquin Phoenix deserves at least an Oscar nod, if not the trophy itself. In an odd way, he reminded me of Sean Penn in that when you watch him, you forget he is an actor, all you see is the character. In reality, the rest of the cast were merely props in this one-man show... even Robert De Niro.

There are a lot of Easter Eggs as nods to other films of the late 70s and early 80s, which was cool.

As an origin story in the comic book universe, Joker was good, better than most. I do not judge movies based on how closely they follow a book or if they follow the rules of physics, but more if they entertain me and allow me to escape my reality for a few hours. In that sense, Joker left me wanting for more. Yeah, there are political nods that you can read into this, but they weren't forced onto the viewer, more of a backdrop.

The randomness of Joker's thinking and thoughts was in a word, distracting. Because the director put me in the lead character's psychosis, I had a hard time sympathizing with any character in the movie, which makes it difficult to connect to the story.

Maybe the real genius of the movie was that randomness, seeing the world through the psychotic mind of the Joker. But it didn't make for a hugely entertaining experience for me."
268,"Cinematography, costume design and one powerhouse performance do not a good movie make. In truth, Joker is poorly paced with a lackluster story that Frankenstiens together elements from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It borrows so liberally I'm amazed it didn't get hit with a plagiarism lawsuit.

Additionally, the movie has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It's sociological commentary is ham-fisted and bland, and it lacks any truly jaw-dropping moments. Outside of the Talk Show scene and a single shot near the end, it's all very forgettable.

And the song for the stair dance sequence was so colossally stupid it completely pulled me out of the film.

That being said, Joaquin was great and the aforementioned cinematography and costume design were very solid. All in all, the movie coasts on Phoenix's mesmerizing portrayal, but never goes far enough to really get under your skin. Biggest letdown of the year."
269,"I see a lot more great reviews for this now but when it first came I saw a lot of hate. I don't understand that at all, those people to me only wanted an action movie as they apparently didn't have the intelligence to understand a psychological thriller like this. As I stated, this wasn't trying to be an action movie, it wanted to show the Jokers transformation from harmless crazy guy down the street to full on psychotic criminal kingpin. I don't think this is really a major spoiler, but I loved how we were able to see young Bruce Wayne's story unfold in the background as well! I told my sister when we talked about a sequel that if she wanted to know what happens next, go straight to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight, then you'll be able to watch two brilliant performances in a row as the Joker, (You were awesome, too, Bale, but this is about the Joker- lol). and basically see the whole story of his life in those two movies. But, that's not to say I'm not onboard with a Joker sequel! I think this is in the running, if not the front runner, for my best movie if the year, but I'll have to sit down and have a look at all the others I've seen! Awesome flick!"
270,This movie is stunning. Joaquin Phoenix performance as the Joker is one of the greatest of all time. Combine with an amazing script and Joaquin Phoenix's amazing performance give us a character driven film that is one of the best movies ever made.
271,Do your self a favour and watch this movie before it gotten spoiled
272,"Casting was really good. No crazy surprise breakaway performances - everybody fit their parts and held their own (which is hard in the face of Phoenix and DeNiro).

But the way the story unfolds, the foreshadowing, the grand revelations - absolutely masterful! Nobody would ever expect such good writing to be invested in a comic book villain origin story, but alas..."
273,"It is an awesome movie indeed. Orchestra, fotography, cinematography, Joaquin Phoenix did his best role performance ever. He is in it, and you will be consumed by this movie. Deserves every oscar! Movie of the year!"
274,Outstanding film. Acting was superb and this was a complete breath of fresh air compared to the other bang bang woo super hero films with zero depth. Joquin is an outstanding actor. Cinematagrophy was brilliant. I wouldn't ever call a film about comic book hero's powerful but Joker is indeed a powerful film
275,"A modern classic, ""Joker"" is dark, uncomfortable and uncompromising.

The perfect origins movie.

9 out of 10."
276,"Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, dull story-line.."
277,"The comparisons to Taxi Driver are more than accurate and reminds you of other loner-vigilante style noir movies (Drive), but make no mistake, this has it's own mystique. Other people have already (and will continue) to explain why this movie is already a timeless classic. The themes explored here are ubiquitous in decades of character study cinema, but it never feels dull in this movie, it feels like a mind-stimulating food-for-thought.

This movie made me FEEL, it made it's presence FELT. There was palpable tension in the theater, we knew we were witnessing something truly grandiose, but restrained enough to not push the pretentious border. It's a shame that this movie might have a stigma around it due to hyperbolic hysteria by headline/attention-seeking critics because there are far more violent films out there than this, this just happened to call out society and make the creators of a psychopath feel culpable, the truth hurts. This movie tells the truth.

Joaquin Phoenix is a master at playing the brooding/unhinged role.

If you watch movies for the purpose of wanting something to leave an impression on you, this is your movie. It does that in spades, and is one that welcomes repeat viewing.

My movie of the year for 2019. Don't think another will come close. The House That Jack Built was my movie of the year for 2018, so I guess you can say I have a certain taste :)"
278,"In a city seething with class antagonism, the mental illness of a struggling clown flourishes into messianic and murderous insanity.

Woah! That's a bold story, and the lead role does it justice, as the character becomes a sort of hall-of-mirrors reprise of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, with uncanny poses and dance moves. And of course, de Niro is present too, with shades of The King Of Comedy.

But you can see the problem right there, with all the emphasis on the actors and not so much on story or theme. It is engaging, and well paced and edited, but a bit linear and simplistic. Maybe comic book heroes are fit only for comic books, and expecting them to take on the injustices of the American Way is to ask too much. At least they had the guts to go for it.

On reflection, I think maybe the concept started in too low a gear - if you state that we live in a crazy, mixed-up system, the audience is already with you. What we really want to see is the dawning of the Age of Joker, as the mantra Life Is A Joke infects everything, even the most innocent thing, until we realise Joker is an inevitable outgrowth of the jokers who run this system.

The sound is very good, with a constant hubbub of tinny TVs, the guy in the apartment upstairs shouting, ""Shut up!"", and the din of Gotham's chaotic streets. Also, the music keeps reminding you of Sinatra's genius for hitting unexpected notes that are just right. Most interesting part of the cinematography is the giant architecture.

Overall: Interesting, not awesome.

ps. The best line is a clever gag nicked from Bob Monkhouse: ""When I was growing up I told them I wanted to become a comedian. They laughed at me then ...."""
279,"Joaquín Phoenix's unconvincing laughing, and looking like a beaten dog had brutaly ennoyed me after 5 minutes. The world is mean and bad, and you can only be bad and hit back. Chaos, anarchy, whatever .. inspires bye a clown who killed 3 bullies. More of this stupid excess of brutality in the name of... what? Yes. It is the same director as in the hangover 3. I don't want to be a partir of this. Brutal and boring."
280,"Cult classic with amazing acting ...not everyones cup of tea but for movie freaks its d best ,,reviews r not meant for such movies Nd Oscar is nothing for dis movie"
281,"So I wasn't sure what to expect. I'd heard some of the hype and I've always been a fan of the Joker stories in the past. I knew Todd Phillips was a decent filmmaker and Joaquin was an amazing actor. What I didn't know, was how well-crafted this film would be. I didn't realize the length of the movie wouldn't be noticed because of how transfixed you were on Joaquin as Joker. I was mesmerized! The viewer is completely immersed into Arthur's world. You feel as if you're a fly on the wall, watching and holding your breath from the intensity. It's truly amazing, to not see an actor but to just simply see Arthur or Joker. I haven't felt this immersed in a character since Daniel Day Lewis played Abraham Lincoln. He deserves all of the buzz, all of the recognition and all of the praise. I'm almost disturbed by his performance because it was so raw and so real. I'm just awe struck."
282,"This is a slow movie, but there are violent scenes of action throughout to keep you interested. This movie is not ""that"" violent, but it is the most violent movie based on a DC character. You see people get shot in the head with blood flying out, people getting their heads smashed in with brains showing, and well as people getting got multiple times in the chest.

This movie has some good twist and turns I didn't see coming and it has a great final act.

9/10"
283,Joker the character that make us laugh but this joker is that man how gives us courage and show our real face . The story is perfect we don't need Batman . If there is joker we can watch joker without any superhero. The story is all about respect. How arther stuggle for there life's . The movie tells that if we fera anyone to much that person will make fear you . Joker laugh make you crazy and gives you courage. How your inspiration can demotivate you the movie is full of emotion and psylogy must watch movies for those how is dimotiavte no compare between this legend Only psylogy killer if you 16 the. Watch this masterpiece.
284,"No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.

Watch it"
286,"To paraphrase Joker: We got what we deserved.

Imagine a world in which the same artistic effort invested in bringing Joker to screen has been used to produce the movies based on Marvel and DC characters in the past two to three decades. Clearly such a scenario isn't suitable for this Earth, rather for a parallel universe, a topic thoroughly explored by both studios.

Jokes apart (no pun intended), Joker arguably surpassed any movie based on a comic book character. Christopher Nolan with his Batman trilogy got halfway there and Superman Begins (2006), Kenneth Branaghs Thor (2011), as well as Hulk (2003) with Eric Bana, all get merely an honorable mention. To be honest, DC always cared more about the content, while Marvel worried about ""the fun factor"" which eventually led us to this movie.

When you strip down the hype surrounding Joker we're left with a decent drama. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a fine performance, although it is based on several of his previous roles, with obvious comparisons being The Master (2012) and Two Lovers (2008), although his bare back features here, similar as in Quills (2000).

On the side note, Robert De Niro decided to act after years, if not decades, of mailing in his performance for the camera. This fact alone deserves praise."
287,Best dark thriller suspense movie you will get. This movie is a masterpiece. Phoenix is a true master the art of transforming himself into this character. Definitely a top contender for Oscar. Bravo!
288,"Sure it was insightful into what,became of the Joker but.. felt slow & dragged out,in several spots. I liked all the actors from previous films,therefore perhaps was expecting more. The previews to this movie,also made it seem a bit more interesting. Watch it & decide yourself."
289,"It's somewhat fortuitous that I saw the pilot episode of that dreadful Batwoman TV show on the same day I saw Joker. The two seem such polar opposites - one is rabid intersectionalist propaganda clumsily shaped by a newly-menstruating 13-year old into something that is almost *entirely* unlike anything recognizable as an actual story, with actual characters and believable situations, dialogue and acting.

The other is... well, something other than that - I'm not entirely sure what, but whatever that something is, it can't help but come as something of a relief.

The trailers at the cinema were for Feminist Terminator, Feminist Star Wars and 'The Emancipation of Harley Quinn': all explicitly anti-male, openly and unapologetically attacking and tearing down men and masculinity - and at the same time still fully expecting to appeal to the great majority of action, sci-fi and superhero fans, who have always been male.

In 2019 it's hard to be a man and go to the cinema or turn on the TV without being told you're obsolete, or 'toxic', or just the biggest problem facing the world today since cancer. In 2019, Joker is the only big film which doesn't do that, the only film which looks at a straight white man as first and foremost a fragile human being in need of love, care, protection and help. In 2019, this, apparently, is a terrible, dangerous, unforgiveable and revolutionary act.

Ho hum.

* * *

So look, the film has its strengths and weaknesses:

On the plus side there is, as everyone knows, Joaquin Phoenix's astonishing performance - one of the most gripping pieces of screen acting ever. His Joker is just every tortured, beaten, defeated soul wrapped up in a weak, paper-thin shell that is slowly tearing apart and open before our eyes. He does a great job of showing the effects of the 'double bind' - the strain of being constantly instructed to do (or not do) opposing, contradictory or sometimes impossible things, which can snap an overburdened mind and at least potentially play a role in bringing on schizophrenia. I noticed several deliberately placed moments illustrating this early on in the movie.

Secondly, the gorgeous cinematography, on grainy celluloid immediately makes one feel one is watching a stone-cold classic movie from the very start. It feels very much like it could have been shot in 1982 by Martin Scorcese, and there are vigorous nods to both Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy, as well as a bunch of other 70s crime films. I enjoyed that paying homage aspect of it very much.

Thirdly, it is a gritty, realistic, serious and seriously made film - the like of which is rarely attempted today, and of course never as a superhero movie. This, though, is not entirely good news, which brings us to the minuses:

The minuses are it's not a superhero movie of any kind. Grey-haired Joaquin seems a little too old for an origin story, and tone-wise, the only film that this could conceivably be a prequel to is The Dark Knight, and even that at a considerable stretch. I repeat for emphasis: Joker is not a superhero movie. Nothing extraordinary or fantastical happens that diverges from the ordinary wretched reality you can read about each day in the newspaper headlines. Because of that, it is quite a considerable downer, never really feels as though it leaves the ground, and eventually one does long for the days of Cesar Romero trapping Adam West in a huge yellow shoe or something.

The more realistic you try to make a superhero comic book story, the less fantastical, and thereby enjoyable and entertaining the story will be. The single, solitary exception to this, the one film that captured lightning in a bottle, which DC have been catastrophically failing to repeat ever since, is The Dark Knight, and perhaps the greatest weakness of this present film is that it tries to take that realism even further, to a point where even the memory of the character the film is being based on in the first place is lost.

In the final analysis, the whole thing just doesn't up to an awful lot, and without the fantastical superhero element the premise in retrospect seems a small and silly thing to base a film on. It feels much more like a biopic of an overly-bullied high school shooter in a clown mask, not a supervillain able to take on little Bruce Wayne all grown up in a batcopter. Phoenix's Joker is so debilitated and weak, with not one single strength or talent on display, it's impossible to imagine him surrounded by henchmen and weilding joke-shop weapons of mass destruction while strapping on a hi-tech utility belt.

None of the other characters are fleshed out even a little, and no-one else's acting is in anything like the same league as the lead. Even though his King Of Comedy is an enormous influence on this film, every time Robert de Niro appears on the screen it just reminds us how he can't be bothered to act anymore, hasn't acted in decades, and now just turns up to collect the money. I have no real complaints about anyone else in the movie, but this is a one man show, and Joaquin Phoenix is the man.

Politically, the film seems to have nothing to say and the constant nods in that direction are muddled and confused and seemingly just there for show. No ideas introduced are dealt with or resolved. It's a film of surfaces.

For all this complaining, though, it's a shallow film that's still something of a must-see, for the mood, the look, the intensity, and Joaquin Phoenix's creepy ol' laugh."
290,"I'm genuinely baffled why people loved this film so much. The pacing seemed awkward, most scenes were boring and contributed little, and then the payoff seemed exaggerated and immense given the build up; and not in an exciting way. Apart from one scene I don't find anything in this film memorable. Gotham did this story better with a side character than this movie did."
291,"I went into this with low expectations. Knowing it would not have Batman nor any action in it.... And wow, was I surprised and impressed. This movie had my full attention from start to finish.

Yes, it is dark and disturbing. But it is a well done dark and disturbing film. The performances were spot on all around.

The ONLY reason I give this movie 9 stars instead of 10 is for the simple fact that the Joker appears to be in his 40's here when he meets Bruce Wayne as a little boy. Meaning that the Joker will be an old fragile man by the time Bruce Wayne eventually grows up to become his arch rival Batman. Batman would have no problem taking him down.

So it will be interesting to see how they handle that in future installments. But THIS initial installment itself was brilliant."
292,"Tonight, I went to see the movie Joker about the origins of Batman nemesis, as you may have noticed by reading my other entries in this diary, I had extremely high expectations for this film. With so many expectations, I thought it would be difficult for this work to touch me or surprise me. Yet coming out of the cinema I was completely dazzled, by what seems to me to be the best film of the decade. This film deals well with the psychology of the character, he approaches the character as never before, the end and the revelations that are made to me took my breath away. Finally, I hope that Joaquin Phoenix, the actor who plays the Joker probably achieved the performance of his life even outperforming his own interpretation of Commodus in the Gladiator film. In Todd Phillips' film Joker, he presented a performance that pays tribute to the great names in film. I am confident that his role will be honored at the Oscars and other major awards ceremonies."
293,"Gotham City. Arthur Fleck works as a clown and is also an aspiring stand-up comic. He has mental health issues, part of which involves uncontrollable laughter. Times are tough and, due to his issues and occupation, Arthur has an even worse time than most. Over time these issues bear down on him, shaping his actions, making him ultimately take on the persona he is more known as...Joker.

Great drama. While the movie fits into the Batman universe, and this could easily be seen as a prequel to Joker's character in The Dark Knight (where Joker was played superbly by Heath Ledger), this is not a comic-book movie. If it was a comic-book movie, it would have ended up another one in a long, seemingly endless line of them, one hardly discernible from the next.

No, this is a human/psychological drama, and a very good one. Writer-director Todd Phillips creates a dark, depressing world with Arthur Fleck one of its primary casualties. The slow, inevitable progress of Arthur Fleck from innocent man to master-criminal is an interesting journey as Phillips rachets up the tension.

What was then required was a performance that captured that darkness, helplessness and gradual disintegration and Joaquin Phoenix gives that, perfectly and spectacularly. Spot-on casting and delivery.

Not quite the perfect movie though. Pacing was a bit off: some scenes seem dragged out too long. I know Phillips was drawing it out to create tension and atmosphere, but on a few occasions it feels like he overdoes it.

It is also difficult, from a point, to be sympathetic towards Arthur Fleck. You start out supporting him, feeling that he is a victim rather than a villain, but, as his actions become more extreme, that engagement wanes.

The story also feels like it is missing something to make it 100% complete. No, I'm not expecting this to link in with The Dark Knight. In fact, many of the Batman references actually seemed unnecessary, more there for audiences to gasp and say ""Oh, so that's how Joker fits in with Batman"", rather than adding anything to this story. A few scenes beyond the final scene might have been in order, to see more of Joker's history.

Overall, still a great movie though."
294,"I have to admit I have a short attention span however I could not even look away for a second during this movie.

It's so hard to watch the pain Arthur is going through, battling with mental illness myself and seeing his journal in the beginning saying how people expect you to act like nothing is wrong hit home.

This movie is not your average comic book, this is a deep though provoking drama. Phoenix is INCREDIBLE"
295,"If I have to speak about acting after you have scrolled down the star cast section, I would do a disservice to the actors and the director.

So, we would talk about the outstanding story, wonderful script writing, surprising cinematography and marvelous character development- things that we do not talk about that often.

This movie shows how you can make a Shawshank Redemption kind of film from a comic book character.

Make Todd Phillips the creative head of DCEU and you will have more such masterpieces."
296,"This is Tod Philips first serious film and for what it is it's pretty good . It has good cinematography and acting and it has good music . The direction is also quite good . However you can tell this is a film from someone who has only directed comedy films . It isn't bad , its actually quite good for a first time , but you can tell it isn't as clever as other films like it . It isn't a masterpiece like people say , but it's pretty good . I think most people will enjoy this film if it sound interesting to them ."
298,"The cinematography is outstanding and leaves an impression that's hard to erase. The focus on how Joker became himself pays off and makes total sense in the end despite it being detriment to society and, as such, prone to criticism from society as an invalid cause by axiom. So this film had to be made as an antidote to Batman universe backdrop. His interactions as a person with characters you might meet any day of your life are genuine and without shallow disguise.. which makes the movie so tragic. Nevertheless, this is not the full picture. I personally enjoyed The Dark Knight's ""developed"" Joker much more though am very thankful to the author of this movie to put the effort to make this. A must watch."
299,"The music visuals are good and Joaquin does a pretty good job , but generally the film feels a bit beginnerish , probably because the director is mostly known for comedy films and its his first serious film . Not to say it's bad it just feels like it's not implementing its technique in a masterful way . It's a start but no amazing achievement like lots of people are saying . It's not bad by any means but it's no masterpiece . I'm interested in what Tod Philips will do after this , I feel like he could get better if he made more films like this ."
303,One of the best films I've seen for ages. Phoenix deserves an Oscar.
304,"This is a hell of a tale with some questions raised about today's tendency to ignore the mentally ill people in our society by the lack of specialised care for individuals.who need 24 hour treatment What a performance by the lead man it slowly draws you in and you follow his unfortunate story to become the Supervillain we all know. It is worth seeing this film and watch a master at work bringing a different version of the joker to the big screen .The cinematography is great ,colourful and moody and the soundtrack just works alongside the gritty visuals So many twists explain why he becomes the man he does I am not going to spoil anything . Joaquin Pheonix is my favourite actor and never disappoints but he has gone a step up here in portraying a very mentally challenged character here .and deserves his acting to be rewarded"
305,"This movie will affect you. It speaks to society, it speaks to the human condition, it speaks to our darker instincts. It's gritty, human, and in some small way profound.

It's beautifully shot, artistic, very well acted, the the score is absolutely effective and well done. I don't rate this 10 lightly. It's not a film to be merely entertained, but it is a ride, and it's a film to talk about. See it, it's rare something like this comes along."
307,"Lauded by critics and rightly so, what we have here is a frankly astonishing look at a man's spiral into madness thanks to a society that fails him. Joaquin Phoenix puts in perhaps the performance of his career, and despite being quite an uncomfortable watch you just can't look away. Essential viewing."
311,"How easily pleased have some people become? When a 'major' movie is this simplistic and obviously just another copy of many other overrated downers - it leaves someone needing to explain how this nonsense then goes on to rate a ridiculous 11 Oscar nominations? Who can truly take the Oscars seriously any longer? Joker is a typical super-ugly, comic book R Rated serial killer story - which grinds its endless way through non-stop, grotesque situations of the most maudlin kind. We've already seen this character (somewhat over-played by Phoenix) far too many times in the past. Even the dark, sleazy settings don't invite interest, and has left many viewers wanting it all to end quickly but no, it drags on for over two hours, feeling painfully more like three.

Then there's the casting of an over-used De Niro, intended to help capitalise on some of those 'gangster- obsessed' Scorsese offerings. Many paid to see this over-hyped lowbrow tosh, expecting to experience a masterpiece - only to wish they could get back their time and money for better use.

If uninspired morbidity is your thing, you'll get a bellyful - otherwise, stay well away and watch this junk fade into the obscurity it deserves, hopefully, along with the copycat movie makers. The final images this movie creates of carnage on the streets of America, looks more like the sorry, robotic BLM mayhem that's reducing the USA to a decaying mess. Just what the CCP and others would be quite happy to see - Civil War. Such a pitiful shame and a sick joke."
312,"If you are someone, who is a bit more sensitive and is scared of violent movies, this movie will touch you.

If you are someone, who expects a lot of action and does not bother with violence, this movie can be disappointing.

To me it feels that this movie was more about getting a message about nowadays society sent to everyone and also about getting a performance of a lifetime for Joaquin Phoenix than actually about the story itself or Joker.

I enjoyed it but expected more. When the movie ended, this is where I actually wanted for the movie to begin as it seemed like the actual beginning of Joker!"
313,"I was blown away by the phenomenal performance of Joacquin Phoenix, absolutely top acting !!"
314,"This is a dark, twisted, sad and sympathetic take of possibly the most enduring comic book villain of all time. DC would be wise to keep taking risks like this and blurring the genre lines because this is where they have a change to excel in an area the MCU won't cross into for fear of not being family friendly. If you cannot match Marvel in an interconnected universe then the answer lies squarely in making quality solo, if not one-off films like this. Phoenix is one of the top actors of his generation and I think it is possible to judge this take on Joker without even comparing to Ledger's. Both are genius and both very different. I have to go off topic and say the one person I'd love to have seen play a live action version was Mark Hamill at the right point in time but we'll have to just give him the best maniacal Joker laugh award and be content with that."
315,"A good movie if you want to watch go!! The acting is great, the story is grateful. And Joker is The Movie of 2019 Overall."
316,"Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies. This movie is about a character, not action or explosions. Joaquin Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and how power can be obtained. Todd Phillips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every other important aspect of the film. The movie gave me instant 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy' vibes, without copying both films. This movie will drag you into your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering. Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better joker - Heath or Joaquin? The answer is - both did a phenomenal job. And Joker is fortunate to have being played by two phenomenal actors. Finally, whether you like it or not, there's no denying you're going to be talking for a long, long time."
317,Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips come through in one of the greatest renditions of a well-known comic villain's life story
318,"I enjoy different types of movies. I love ""popcorn movies"", silly comedies, almost anything done reasonably well. Then there are movies like this one. A great movie is like an Alfred Hitchcock movie. It doesn't just leave you there in your seat unaffected by it. This movie is at different times, genuinely disturbing, puzzling, electrifying, and unpredictable as to what will happen next. Excellent writing & cinematography, which would have gone to waste if not for the incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix. If you love to see what the art of acting is about, go see this movie."
319,"The movie is very well made in almost every way. It details how the joker becomes - the joker. It makes sense that the journey is not a particularly pleasant experience and I guess lots of people can appreciate it. But I did not enjoy watching this movie very much. It was simply too depressing for my taste. And the joker too miserable.

I left the cinema with a feeling that I would have been better off not watching it.

But hey, that was just my experience."
320,"A lot has already been said about this film since it's release. It's a movie that will be hated by those who blindly overdose on the instant gratification and throw-away feel-good marvelesque movies, and loved by Dark Knighters who crave for brooding character development.

It's not an easy film to watch. But it is captivating in a similarly slow-burn visually sumptuous way of past films it gives homage to: Taxi Driver, Kings of Comedy, Dog Day Afternoon and more. And similar to these movies, at it's heart is a central character whose slow slide down the ladder of society results in a series of pressure-valve-release gratuitous actions (towards the end).

Whilst the movie misses a beat in using the stellar supporting cast to best effect, what it does do is act as a prequel to Batman that shows there's always two side's to every story. The Joker isn't born bad. And he doesn't knowingly derail young Bruce Waynes life. But ultimately he does find 'himself' in the events that unfold around his actions, and which snowballs through the media.

It's here that a lot of the commentary on social extremism has been pointed, and with some justification. But what it really shows is that we all want to be treated as human beings. To be seen. To be heard. To be cared for. To be respected. To be loved. And to belong.

Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker to find these things - that were missing in his life.

It's here that it hits close to home, as so many of the events unfolding in our lives today are a result of similar sense of alienation and frustration with society letting people down. From a lack of compassion, care and respect for each other."
322,"Didn't enjoy this in the cinema and I didn't enjoy it at home. It's not saying anything coherent about how we treat mentally ill people or what a coarse society can do to a person. The story is Nonsensical and relentlessly grim and, while I'm willing to suspend disbelief enough to buy a man in a bat suit, i can't suspend it enough To believe a person like fleck would be treated in the way his is treated. Am also meant to believe this guy is a criminal mastermind? Or perhaps that none of it happened except in his head? Whatever. It's pointless dross. People who think this is great clearly don't watch many films."
323,"This is the definition of the word STUNNING! Because that's what Phoenix was at this movie! It is a performance of a lifetime! I have no idea how he achieved this turn and brought this character to its highest but it cant get any better. We love all Jokers but here we have a different character, a different man, a man that we can finally understand, finally understand Joker's Why... This character was portrait-ed multidimensional by Phoenix! It was about time to expose today's society. This movie will shock you in a way, make you sad and at the end it will make you happy with the Batman connection and the comic and gaming scene! The whole movie was a masterpiece and can lead to many awesome sequels with Batman, Harley Quin etc... They just need to be careful. An Oscar performance with a small budget! Good job DC."
324,"Three words: believe the hype Brilliantly and beautifully told, absolute haunting masterpiece."
325,"This is a phenomenal movie with a great story that leaves you to question who's right or wrong and what's real or not, amazing and haunting music, uncomfortable and scary moments but there very well done, beautifully made, and of course Joaquin Phoenix giving a jaw dropping performance. All the other actors do good as well (Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, etc.) but it's Joaquin is what holds the movie together and he totally deserves his Oscar for best actor (Hildur guonadottir Also deserves her Oscar for best original score). My 2nd favorite dc movie and a must watch."
326,"By the time the roll credits started to show up, I was still not prepared to properly rate this movie. I would say it's one of the most overwhelming experience I've had in the cinema. After letting it simmer for a while, I'm definitely confident to say that it's one of the best movies this year thus far.

The story of ""Joker"" shows us the downward spiral of Arthur Fleck, a down-on-his-luck comedian and a mentally unstable man with a disorder that prompts him to laugh uncontrollably at any situation that causes stress.

That's enough of a plot description, because what you are about to see is a harrowing journey that at some point will make you so uncomfortable you almost can't bear it. Not saying that it went too far, violence-wise, but it's almost too depressing to be entertaining.

Joaquin Phoenix embodies the character so well and convincing that you can't help but be in awe of what he has achieved here. It's almost a one-man show, to be honest. The side characters are sidelined (pun intended) just so we could witness his transformation from this meek, nice guy to the titular Joker. Still, Robert DeNiro as the talk show host also served as a highlight.

I'd also say that I was never bored throughout the 2-hour runtime, given the grim and oppressive nature of the story. The slow-burn pacing is top notch and contrasted with some gruesome violence. Yes, it has visual cues from Scorcese classics (the aforementioned ""Taxi Driver"" is one of them) but there's nothing to distract me as unoriginal or something of a copy and paste. Some developments are really surprising and managed to bring some intrigue that will bring viewers to question what's really true or not, most importantly how it ties with a particular character (you could guess who it is).

I gotta say that this has the best third act any movie could offer. My jaw dropped right at the climax for how audacious and sharp the way things were handled in it. There are powerful messages on how society works and how we should treat people with mental illness, especially to people like Arthur in this day and age that will resonate with me long after I watched it.

Overall, I do think it has a staying power to be an essential movie or a classic outside the comic-book genre. Despite the controversy and the polarizing reviews, I'd recommend seeing it for how it pushes the boundary in commercial and mainstream filmmaking."
327,This is a dark and twisted take on this iconic character. I love the approach Todd took with this character. No this is not a world building comic book film; this film is a character study on a tragic character that was abandoned from society at a young age and turned into a twisted psychopath. Joaquin is Arthur and is so lifelike I felt as if I was watching a found footage film. And yes I'm aware this is not a found footage film but you know what I mean. I love the twist in this film and how it dove deeper into his illness. We are viewing a disturbing individual that has many internal problems and I feel the cinematography compliments the world Arthur is viewing. You are viewing a colorfully dark picture which is what I feel Arthur is viewing daily. Arthur is fighting between colorful (positive) and dark (negative) emotions. There is not much plot in this film but the psychological illness this character brings fixes the lack of story. The ending does go on a little too long but nevertheless it just adds to this iconic character!
328,"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography. Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care. Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker. I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight. Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors. Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away 1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker."
329,"Put on a happy face and smile coz with Joker, the greatest comic-book supervillain at last gets his very own origin story, and it is exactly how it must be: Dark, bleak, deranged, manic, wretched & downright nihilistic. Also, with no good to counter the evil this time around, it is a full-on descent into madness & hysteria that viewers are either gonna detest or embrace wholeheartedly.

Co-written & directed by Todd Phillips, this standalone take on the origins of the iconic arch nemesis attempts to create his psychological profile by painting a grisly portrait of an unstable mind that's hanging by a thread on the edge of insanity until he finally snaps. Discarding the existing blueprint of its genre, this reincarnation of Joker offers a low-budget, grounded treatment but with hugely rewarding dividends.

Though Phillips' direction could dig into Joker's unhinged persona to only a certain extent, Joaquin Phoenix's chilling rendition of the eponymous psychopath bridges the gap and overcomes the few nitpicks with thrilling intensity, for he is gripping & breathtaking throughout. Other vital inputs come from the story's nihilistic tone & treatment, its grim atmosphere, sudden brutal violence, and Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting score.

Scarier than most horror films of today, Joker bestows the notorious madman with an origin story that's as plausible as it is cold & callous, and makes for an insanely riveting character study that works even if one strips the premise off its comic book roots. Driven by Joaquin Phoenix's powerful, unsettling & memorable performance, this cautionary tale of a psychotic who in search for identity mistakenly becomes a symbol is arguably the best film of the year."
330,"J. Phoenix must have lost a lot of weight for this role, which I guess was one of the biggest reasons he won all the awards. Yes, he was awesome, but the movie wasn't. It needed more action. The film is about the descent of a mentally ill man, failed by society, as he becomes more unstable and eventually leads to murder. He learns his mother has been lying to him and becomes unglued around her. The only thing I didn't get was this supposed to be the same Joker whom squares off with Batman. Because Bruce Wayne is just a kid and Arthur already looks to be 40 something. so how is that. And at the end he is in a facility, well how does he do the things the Joker did. Are we to assume he escaped or the Joker in Batman was a copy cat.

FINAL VERDICT: Good film, but overrated. Worth checking out."
331,"You either LOVE this film or you HATE it. Plain and simple, sure there's people that find the middle ground between rating it 5-8 /10 but those are the people who see the flaws, and don't like them, or the ones who see the flaws, but thinks they help the movie more. Joker is a middle finger to the society we live in. Joker IS a satire, society sees your troubles and laughs in your face. VERY good film and it's a 10/10 without question. If you don't agree that's fine, if you think it's a 1/10 that's fine too. It's not a film meant for everyone."
332,"Saw the movie Joker; it's ok nothing special. It's a weak Taxi Driver with face paint where a drug addict loser blames everybody(white people) for all his failings. Phoenix is great as usual but the movie is just mediocre and actually offensive in its ultra-liberal preaching. Millennials will love it because it reinforces their high school and college teachings that nothing is their fault. Just their parents, their boss, the government, society, their neighbors, the cops, God and everything else but them. That's why it has a 9 on IMDb. because it's superior to The Godfather to this generation. As a movie it is like the Millennials; it is pathetic."
333,"BORING!! Boring.... so boring as hell!

I want my 2 hours back!

The only joker I loved was in the ""Dark Night"", this one was very talented.

There is no logic in this movie, producers are as sick as they joke(r), nothing in the brain."
334,"I think it's understandable to see why people wouldn't like this movie, it's not a base villian orgin story that we expect from marvel or DC and I think many people expected that going in. The film is very uncomfortable and that's the point. At no point do you feel like the bad things Author is doing is ok, you know it's wrong but you have understanding on why this broken man is making these choices and the situations he's been forced into by predjudice and violence from an outside society. The praise for this movie is well deserved and the messages and themes are important and should be dissected. Though be really for a very bloody and intense experience."
335,"This film has a great awareness to mental health. It keeps you guessing with alot of hidden meaning to some of the scenes.

This is definitely a different take to how the joker became to be with a more realistic feel to how it may of all happened within his own mind.

This dances on the line of personality disorder and the help that isn't openly recieved for it this really is an eye opener of how easily these things can happen to people and how it should be taken more seriously Definitely a great watch and aof great educational value."
336,"So this was well promoted on every social net you could think. So this was told to be the best flick of 2019, So many things were said and so I was afraid it was overhyped.

Let me tell you, not one bit. First of all, happy to see Robert De Niro back in a flick that suits him. No more comedies please Robert. Secondly, the comparing all over the net between Ledger and Phoenix. They are both excellent in their own ways.

The movie itself. Starts off rather as a normal flick, except for opening credits which took me back to the old WB logo's and yellow lettering of the seventies, but quickly turns into a dark movie getting darker and darker and more and more insane. The way it was shot, the score my God, really well done.

And then there's the performance that couldn't beat Ledger. Well, Ledger I do still like as the Joker but what Phoenix did as the sart of the Joker is really really worth the Oscar. The skinny body, the laughter, the sick looks. with De Niro in it it did remind me of Taxi Driver who one person can turn from a desperate person into a mad person.

Towards the end I was thinking, okay, so far 10 out of 10 but are they going to ruin the link towards Batman. They didn't, the last 15 minutes, man, it fits perfectly into the Batman world.

It's been a while I have seen such a flick, and after some Marvel rather boring stuff (Avengers Endgame for example) again I was shown that DC is my thing.

I can go on and on. The impossible mission to beat Ledger, well, the Oscars will proof that it has been done.

Be warned, rated 16+, totally correct due the brutal action and the downward spiral of the story

337,"One of the most anticipated films of the year, and one of the most unwanted, at first. Following Jack Nicholson, Jared Leto, and (the best) Health Ledger, was not easy but they got another renowned actor, Joaquin Phoenix, to play his take on the notorious villain. On top of the actor, the direction was up in the air and the choice of giving the reins over to Hangover director Todd Phillips was more worrisome. However, knowing Phoenix takes choosing his roles very seriously-only picking up the good ones-made having confidence in Phillips easier. Having a director suddenly switch genres and go in a totally different direction has been seen before and with Phillips, we get the surprise, and laugh, that we wanted. Joker delivers exactly what you'd expect and want and then gives you more than you ever could have imagined. This film pushes the boundaries, it gives the gritty realism of the world's cruel moments their spotlight. It may receive backlash for it's brutally honest portrayals, it has already even before it was released. Though, it will definitely leave you thinking about it's many messages as you sit and watch the credits roll with Sinatra's perfectly themed song. The controversies are created by the stirring up of the thoughts in the audiences' minds after witnessing Arthur Fleck's character development. This buzz does good in making this film more popular but more importantly gets the public to think more about the lessons to be learned about how to treat others. Sure, the main takeaways can easily be focused on the violence depicted and how striking it is, but it's the journey leading up to the acts that should be pondered on more. It's this very character arc that makes this movie so powerful and moving. It's brutal but it's real, that's what hits home the most. Phoenix's performance is lived-up to and yes, Oscar-worthy. He clearly has taken preparation for the role seriously since he's lost over 50 pounds and nailed the sinister, contagious laugh, making his own twist on it by making it a condition of an uncontrollable laughter that Fleck has. You are glued to every scene he is in, waiting to see what unpredictable thing he'll do next, which is exactly who the Joker is at his core. Chaos. There's also beautiful cinematography that complements with the subtle, yet terrifying, score. The clear and present Scorsese influence and nods-to are seen and invited, Robert freakin' De Niro is in this, come on people. Phillips also really brings us into this grimy urban 80's setting of Gotham perfectly. The cold harsh streets littered with trash and the poverty-stricken rundown housing. Since there has been so much worrisome talk about this film, before it even was released to the world, you have to get the hint that it is not one to miss. However, when you do see it, go in as open-minded as possible or just go with premeditated ideas, the Joker is sure to rattle you anyways by the end of it. Either way, the messages and thought-provoking questions that this film instills into the audience is what truly sets this film apart. It's a masterful work of original filmmaking and we get to witness it, so please, sit back and just smile. -TE (10.3.19)"
338,"Unquestionably the most sensational autobiography on a villain I've seen to date. Joker is masterful in almost every aspect, but most importantly, able to truly focus on the inner workings of perhaps the most well-known in the superhero realm. The best part of the film is that it is not dumbed down to suit the fanboys, it is done in a mature and art-house way to influence and inspire the audience. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar level performance that is one for the ages. Also love the uncertainty of every scene, the constant questioning of what is real and what is not. The eccentricity of the character does not feel forced, it conjures a sort of sympathy from the audience throughout the film. Every scene, every movement and every dialogue felt sinister in a poetic way.Not sure if the DC Universe can follow suit after this, but I think they should leave this as an independent work. Felt the last scene with Thomas Wayne is somewhat unnecessary and broke the mood a little."
339,A masterpiece. I have no words to describe this movie!!!
340,This is well worth watching Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant. This is an Oscar worthy performance. It is a masterclass in how the west treat the mentally ill and the working class.
341,"How is this Joker suppost to stand a chance against Batman? I thought what made joker such a great villain was his intelligence, his manipulative ability and his ability to see the inner fears of his rivals. How far will he get by only being crazy and unpredictable? Juaquin could problably get pretty far (all the way to the Oscars stage), while Joker can't even enter through a door."
343,"Just a chill, fun, and enjoyable movie, the joker character at it finest and the development of it was just AMAZING."
345,"One of the best movie ever! It's dark, it's beautiful in a dramatic way, it's sad, it's scary... It's just one of the movie that you HAVE TO WATCH at least twice cuz you might missed something the first time!

Of course Joaquin Phoenix is great, so is the director and the custom designer, set designer, the choreographer, the composer and so much more to make this another classic to go down the history!"
346,"Joker is a masterpiece, an emotional and bold character piece that works extremely well as an origin story for it's title character. Joaquin Phoenix gives an incredible performance that's extremely committed and undoubtedly one of his best and also definitely worthy of an oscar. All the supporting performances are brief but effective, with Robert De Niro giving the best supporting performance. It's extremely well paced and beautifully filmed. The direction by Todd Philips is excellent and proves he can do much more than just comedies. The musical score is incredible as well the soundtrack which works perfectly."
348,"10/10. Not gonna say much! FBI, CIA, NSA all are on the lookout for Joker reviews in social media. Literally!!

Joaquin Phoenix is winning the Oscar. Said and sealed."
349,"It's a beautifully made movie. It's a different take on the Joker origin story. The acting is some of the best I've seen. Stop comparing it to Nolan's Joker, that is not what this is. It's not a action pact superhero film it's a character study of a different type of Joker. If anything it's a more realistic look of how Gotham really is depicted."
350,"Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher."
351,"I rarely write reviews but I felt the need to write one for this movie just to tell everyone that it doesn't even nearly live up to its hype. Yes, the actor's performance is undoubtedly amazing and he deserves an Oscar, but the movie itself was kind of boring. The whole time you know what is going to happen, there is nothing, and I mean nothing, that is unexpected about the plot. It is a movie charged with so much negative energy that you end up leaving the theater being emotionally drained. It has a good message though but so do many other movies as well. The only reason why I gave the movie 7/10 and not 5 or 6 is because the actor truly did a good job. After this movie, I can only hope that Robert Pattinson's Batman will contain not only good acting but good writing."
352,Watched Joker in the cinema a couple of hours ago and am still processing it. It's not the movie you expect but rather way better than you would expect. You won't feel happy watching this movie as the story is about a struggling man. The acting and bizarre movement of Arthur is just perfect. This is a must watch as it will most likely make you feel the need to process what you just experienced.
353,"At the heart of this film is an outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix. And it is that performance itself that I think distracts from a number of the films shortcomings. Aiming for a gritty down-at-heel look from the opening moments, with the recreation of the Warner Brothers logo from the 1970s, you very much get the mood of classics such as the French Connection and Taxi Driver. Films with no real good guy and a very dower and world weary feel. Within this setting we find struggling clown Arthur Fleck, a man suffering from numerous mental health issues who has been overlooked by the support services, and which are in turn themselves been cutback by the city, and ever demanding budget savings. As the film moves on Arthur becomes more downtrodden and isolated, his connection with reality more and more tenuous, until ... well that's the point of the film - the origin of The Joker. But getting here is not a startling revelation, just an all to believable of another troubled person falling through the cracks of the support services, in a city that doesn't care. Which is an issue that needs addressing and is handled so much better in Phoenix's previous film ""You were never really here"". Maybe the point of the filmmakers were to make it a very grounded take, but I feel that in turn misses the concept of the Joker. Remove the face-paint, cut away the pointless Wayne references and you have a much better film. With it and you have yet another actor undertaking a great physical performance but not much else."
356,"If I could go back in time and wipe my memory to watch any movie for the first time again, this would certainly be a contender. Visually STUNNING, incredible direction, strong performances, and a pretty impressive interpretation of Gotham city makes for a great watch. The film does a great job of utilizing every second of screen time to advance the character arc of Arthur, which in my opinion leads to one of the best endings to a film in memory.

P.s. If you're like me and have played the video game Arkham city, I think you'll share some of the nostalgia this movie brought me."
357,"Finally a movie about the Joker done right. And by that I mean, the Joker is done right; including his entire change into the unpredictable psychopath we know from the various comics, cartoons, movies, series, and spin-offs in the DC universe.

Joaquin Phoenix portrays actual real-life insanity. Something I have personally witnessed in my line of work; in at least three certified cases of truly criminally insane people. The kind of insanity which is completely unpredictable, other than the fact that whatever the person is going to do, is guaranteed to make absolutely zero sense to a sane person, but makes one hundred percent complete sense to them. Joaquin Phoenix played his role so well, that this movie actually scared me a little. Especially since I recognized actual symptoms and behaviorism's of known, real psychopaths.

I remember a quote from a movie, by Batman himself: ""...the Joker is insane."" And it was delivered by a very good voice actor, very convincingly. I bet that the person who wrote that line in the script probably had no idea, that this insanity would be so accurately portrayed in a live-action film."
358,Brill commentary on our social condition humanity is in right now. Over medicate those that have been neglected. Bully them into becoming homicidal maniacs and watch them start a cult following. You know that people are taking inspiration from this delicately filmed snapshot of America (and the UK for that matter).
359,"Ugh, another Batman/Joker story... seems like they keep alternating those with Superman reboots. I was never a fan to start with (Marvel comics > DC) but after so many movie/tv/cartoon iterations of the tale, I really didn't care about this movie. Still, considering the raving reviews I had to check it out, and am I glad I did! From the writing to the cinematography and formidable performance by Joaquin Phoenix this is a fantastic movie, even without the Batman/Joker context. If this movie came out years before this franchise's fatigue it would have blown everybody's mind (mine included). Believe the hype and go watch it, you won't regret it!"
360,"A mentally troubled middle-aged clown (Joaquin Phoenix) who lives with his mother (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City goes from not good to worse when he finally realizes his true identity. Robert DeNiro plays a talk show host and Zazie Beetz the friendly girl down the hall. Brett Cullen is on hand as Thomas Wayne, Bruce's rich father.

""Joker"" (2019) is an arty, slow-burn character study of the popular DC Comics' villain, but it's more of a psychological crime drama/thriller and tragedy than a superhero flick (or, in this case, supervillain). The movie's captivating from the get-go and practically everything works for a broodingly superb cinematic experience.

There are several amusing bits, but this ain't a fun flick. It's heavy and tragic. But what's the message? Simply that this is how a quirky man who wanted to make people laugh became The Joker. He's a little reminiscent of the clown in Steve Gerber's ""Night of the Laughing Dead"" in Man-Thing #5 (1974).

The movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in New York City (Bronx, Harlem, Manhattan) and nearby New Jersey (Jersey City & Newark).

GRADE: A-/A"
361,"The performance of Joaquin is excellent but the story simply don't have anything to do with the Joker, it's more about a mentaly ill man struggling with his chaotic enviroment until it's overwhelmed and snaps. I would be a much better film if the title was ""Arthur"" or ""The Clown"" but the fact that it's forced to be related to the batman universe it's why i feld it didn't work."
362,I'll be able to see this movie over and over again!!
364,"Two points: Comic Book movies are overplayed, as non-union CGI 'teams' pipeline the shots and the company makes off with most of the money.

Second point: Joker is NOT a CGI/superhero type movie! It's a 'drama' about a loner who's gritty, depressive, troubled life leads to accidental freak acts of urban violence; the alienated counterculture (who in this case, are not liberal-democratic progressives, but basically nihilistic alt.right losers) cheer him on.

Needless to say, the film is 'daring' for confronting the vast income divide, alienation and random violence in American life in 2019. Now for the the reason I give the movie six out of ten: I'M NOT A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD!! I've already seen the outstanding film King of Comedy, which is just wonderful, and many, many film critics have plastered analysis, superlatives and screen shots from Taxi Driver in magazines everywhere. Interviews where Joaquin Phoenix claims there was 'no mention of these films during production' or 'no intentional references in the movie' are just polite lies. The film is NOT original, despite it's retro genre styling and the fact that it is basically repellent, signalling to auds that this is a (bleurgghh!) comic-book movie that isn't afraid to totally break with commercial conventions.

Is the film great? No. It's narrow, manipulative and secondary characters get occasionally lazy narrative threads. Is Phoenix good? YES - he does some weird stuff, like getting into a fridge, or doing a little interpretive dance in a grimy public bathroom near a subway. The main reason this film is selling well is lack of important material during it's release date."
365,"This movie rips off other movies, doesn't have any redeeming value, and even implies Bruce Wayne is the father of the Joker? What kind of joke is this? Not a DC movie, not an origins story. Just the work of some hack who stole ideas from Scorsese, and tries to make a dangerous, ill man into some kind of folk hero. Unfortunately Joaquim Phoenix just overacts in this one. And he's in literally every single scene in this movie, so it becomes very tiresome to watch. Crap."
367,"When Batman made his debut the year was 1939. In Europe, the nazism was offering a solution to poverty: the chosen and pure ones have to take the lead to organize a better life. This fascist thing was also in the air after the communism had shown its contradictions and violence. With the victory in the II World War liberal democratic countries had to propose a new version of capitalism. This human version, the Welfare State, went through more or less till the 70's when the neoliberalism arrived in the political scene advocating cuts in social expenditures and state shrinking. In a way, Batman and Joker were created from the same ground of despair and hope in the mid of the last century. We are now in 2019. The welfare state capitalism is in the hospital badly wounded. The evil may be explained by a real troubled life of the Joker maybe not. As Joker realizes his potency after every crime perpetrated by him, the young batman must accomplish a double task in the future: to turn Gothan city a livable place for all and to dismantle the joker's way of the necessary use of violence by the dispossessed. If Batman fails in this noble tale, the fascism will come again to organize the jokers promising a better life. Great Film!"
368,Best Joker centered film I have ever seen in my life. Everything about this movie was absolute perfection. I can't think of a single reason why I would take off even 1 point from the perfect 10 that this movie deserves. Brilliant!!! I would watch this again and again and again. This will become a cult classic and will be raved about for years to come. Mark my words.
369,"This is not your ordinary great movie. This is legendary cinematography, acting, direction, narration, art direction, costumes, score, from beginning to end. This is perfection serendipity that comes together when all magic is aligned in the universe. Joaquin Phoenix gives a mesmerizing breath-taking performance that may still haunt you after you leave the theater. His acting is totally flawless in every second of his presence, you are drawn to his character, relating to his world, falling for him, his villain yet deeply angelic psyche. As a character he is unmatched, as an actor he just redefined acting."
370,"I was not a fan of Joaquin Phoneix, but his performance was a career best and his Oscar win a big shock but well deserved. This is the darkest film since American Psycho with a true to characters story that has ever been told. Rejected by mother rejected by society and yet he still smiles. How this film never won best picture is all that's wrong with Oscars and they went with Green book to be safe. Robert de Niro always surprises me how good his acting is. They nominated The film Favorite instead of this film a film where a fat lady gets basted like a turkey and two women fight over right to do it."
371,"Wow just wow, I was skeptical going in thinking anyone would come close to ledger or hamills jokers, but this THIS is nothing short of a performance of a lifetime by phoenix, he has BLOWN ME AWAY!"
372,"Everything about Joker apart from the performance from Phoenix was fine. The score was pretty good as well I guess. However, does having these things make it a masterpiece. Nah lol"
373,"I don't think it is a coincidence that Robert de Niro was an actor in this movie. Joker plays more like Taxi Driver than any movie I've seen. The same slow descent into madness for a disillusioned and ignored man at the edge of society.

I didn't find the film political at all. Because what Phoenix did I felt for his character at a visceral level, beyond good, evil and morality. The entire movie is a joke that only some people get it. The incel thing, for example, was hilarious in retrospect: frightened first worlders trying to instantly put a label on the people that they feared most and needed support more. The exact same reaction as portrayed in the film. The story in this is very personal, in a social context that becomes a constant buzz that fades in the background.

If there is any word that could describe Joker is uncomfortable. It's two hours of feeling the suffering of the main character, even as he breaks and does unconscionable things. You can't not root for him. You can't condone it. You can't not be sad. And in the end, when I was thinking this is a great movie but has nothing to do with the DC comics, it ties in the Batman classic storyline with such ease that I couldn't help shivering thinking on what Batman's story would be in this universe of burning sadness.

Bottom line: great acting and really fresh ideas that work together perfectly. It's a very adult film, though, and not for everybody."
374,Good its deserves it what a great movie (my review is to short lol lemme type longer for a sec)
375,"First of all amidst all chaos i could appreciate the brilliance in Joaquin Phoenix's acting. He has nailed what most of the current lot of actors would not even think of reaching. I can specifically see three different personalities inside his role. He did an amazing job on all three.

Secondly , A film is not all about how well the lead actor performs and binds to his role. It should have a sound cinematography and Script. Joker is seriously do not have a story to relate for the viewers. In the entire film it was just searching for a story or a message to relate for the viewer. Script is just touching here and there but never had a solid flow or emotions attached to it. That is why I never felt sorry or sad about JOKER or the underprivileged people. I was just having zero emotions to the movement he started or for the things he had done in the film.

I would sight this film as a classic example for a failed script which always tried to deliver best scenes for the lead actor. In one aspect Joaquin actually kills all other what would be good factors which would have contributed to overall success of the film. All scenes are directed to make JOKER shine hence the story and the character build up of the rest has been clearly ignored and dumped.

This film can win the award for the best actor in a leading role but will not even nominate for any other categories. What did that tell you ? Success of the film or a failure ? It is up to you to decide.

I would remind you of ""Forrest Gump"" in 1994 . Tom Hanks played a similar role and all the attention was on to him. But it had a very heartwarming and a complex story to tell. Rest of the cast had a role to play in the story. All in all Tom Hanks did not do justice for him but for the entire film. Film ended winning 6 Oscars in 1995 competing with the likes of Shawshank Redemption/ Pulp Fiction."
376,"It was a mastery in film making..from Joaquins performance to Todd Phillip's Visionary.

From A Darker Rendition Of Gotham All the way to how Todd's message regarding 'mental illness' is portrayed & consistently not accepted in an awful Society. This is how you create a character marvel!👏"
377,"Amazing: -acting -story telling -cinematography

It pays homage to previous jokers and surprisingly, this made me want to re-watch the batman movies..."
378,"Joaquin Phoenix is truly Oscar worthy in this adaptation of Joker. He's gripping, troubled, believable and diverse, and I'm yet to watch a comic book adaptation as terrific as this. Suicide Squad eat tour heart out. THIS is how a movie should be made."
380,"For a controversial picture, Joker surprised me as a film with great depth and thought put into it. Its riveting performance from Phoenix mixed with the grittiness of the universe in which it was set made the film one of the best of the year."
381,"Joaquin Phoenix performance here is the best performance of the decade. He most certainly tly deserves an oscar for this. And then when you read some of the improv scenes such as the refrigerator scene or the dancing in the bathroom scene you realize even more how truly great he is in this film. 10 out of 10, my only issue with this film, and why I give it 10 instead of friggin 11 or 12 out of 10 lol, is it should have been a little longer and it should have had him as joker in full makeup doing bigger crimes. In short, they should have gone even bigger in scope with it. Heres hoping he makes a return ;)"
382,"In the early 1980s Gotham City has deteriorated into an incendiary cesspool of crime and apathy where the rich and powerful have cast aside lower-class residents like Arthur Fleck, a party clown who's been disregarded his entire life. In spite of this he aspires to make it as a stand-up comedian, but his troubled history and mental erosion have begun to strip away what remains of his sanity. If you're looking to bring a well-known comic book character to the big screen in a way that's never been done before then look no further: this relentlessly dark and morbid story from Todd Phillips (yes, same one from The Hangover) is a psychologically twisted and unnerving character study of a frightening individual's downward spiral and just how far he'll go to make a name for himself. Intense, riveting, allegorical but equally audacious, chaotic and off-putting with a sluggish first half, how much actual enjoyment is derived from watching it is in the eye of the beholder, but there's no denying the work of Phoenix (with shades of Christian Bale) who dominates the screen with his unflinching portrait of the damaged protagonist...not for the faint of heart. **½"
383,"It's a good film but I don't see this as a 10 like many here did, early reviews are usually from some marketing company to hype things up.

Movie started slow ... don't expect much to happen 'til the middle and it's climax. Cinematography is good. Joker's acting is fine... if a little forced at times, it's just strange but acceptable."
384,"Very dark and gritty drama.

A very violent origin movie about mental illness. A character study of the making of an evil monster.

Joaquin Phoenix really delivers a dark, gritty 'Joker', it's a truly brilliant portrayal of an individual's miserable life, he is an individual only seeking human connection in a society that's in gradual decline. You may even find yourself empathising with the Joker?

This is very different from any other DC (or Marvel) movie that has come before. You may notice that no CGI is utilised throughout the 117 minutes, although none is necessary. The film is all about the atmosphere and an Oscar worthy performance from an almost unrecognisable Joaquin Phoenix, the Oscar board always likes extreme body transformations."
385,Ya it had some cool moments. Overall I honestly couldn't wait for it to end. Boring waste of Phoenix's talents. Maybe just bad directing. 7 outta 10 for effort. Glad I didn't waste my money at the movies with this.. That would of been the real JOKE 😳😅🤡
387,"It's rare when we get to see a movie that's this close to perfect. Normally something or another, sometimes multiple things, are lacking in a movie. It could be one of the actors, the writing, the cinematography could be subpar, and on and on. To have a movie made like that this is so nearly flawless across the board is very special.

Joaquin Phoenix plays, quite likely, his best performance to date which says a lot considering how many great roles he's already done in his life. When I first heard about this movie when it was in the works I'll admit that I thought Joaquin was miscast. Boy was I wrong and in retrospect I'm not sure why I thought that.

Another thing that concerned me initially was that the director, Todd Phillips, was unproven as anything other than a comedy director (to me). Another major miss on my part there. Todd Phillips did an absolutely amazing job both directing and writing this masterpiece of a movie.

Going back to what I said above, most movies suffer from scenes that are either wasteful, serving no purpose or scenes that are flawed. All of these scenes serve a purpose and succeed at it very well by adding to the movie in some way or elevating the movie in some way. Further, there were some scenes that if they weren't in the movie the movie as a whole would have been less cohesive. Todd Phillips did such an amazing job walking the fine line between having redundant scenes or scenes that barely told us enough to paint the picture of how The Joker became The Joker.

Truly an amazing movie. I'd rate it between a 9.5 and a perfect 10."
389,Omg one of the best dc films out there blew my breath away. The performance of all the characters were outstanding and I love the twist and turns
390,"While the film Pi delivers a variant of losing ones mind, this film is a perfect introspection on the hell and realities of psychosis. Enjoy!"
391,"2019 America is crazy enough to prepare us for Joker, and yet none of us were. In recent memory, there hasn't been a theatrical experience that has generated this much fear, anxiety and excitement as this one has. That's because Joker seems real. All too real for many people. There have been many films in the past that study the deranged and unstable in our society. Joker even pays homage to many of those films. But what was once just morbid curiosity in art has become a grim and horrifying reality for the American people. A never-ending string of mass-shootings and terrorist attacks have shaped our crumbling civil society. It leaves people shattered enough to see a film like Joker in an entirely different light. The times we live in will forever define the kind of film this is. Make no mistake, Joker is a dangerous film. It's the most subversive film to come along since Natural Born Killers. Yet, for this fact alone, Joker is an unparalleled cinematic event. Not to mention, it's pretty damn good.

It's the would-be origin story of Batman's archenemies, placed in a version of Gotham that resembles New York City's not-so-distant past. The Joker's real name is Arthur Fleck, who lives with his ailing mother in a dingy apartment. By day, he's a rent-a-clown, twirling signs outside of closing department stores. But Arthur can't catch a break. In fact, his life is a living hell. He gets beat up in the streets, ridiculed at open mic nights, struggles with meeting women, barely comes home with enough money for food and frequently embarrasses himself by laughing uncontrollably due to a neurological disorder. Meanwhile, as Gotham continues it's decay, a billionaire tycoon with a familiar name rises in politics. Unfortunately for Arthur, he shares a shameful connection with him that his mother never bothered to disclose. Eventually, Arthur snaps. A rough run-in with three boorish Wall Street brokers ends with a Bernie Goetz style bloodbath on the subway, and from there, it's off to the races. Arthur's misery begins to melt away. Suddenly, he comes alive by inflicting merciless violence on the people that have done him wrong. If that wasn't bad enough, the unwashed city dwellers of Gotham find an unlikely hero in Arthur for having stood up to the rich, and unintentionally starts a violent class uprising capable of bringing whatever's left of Gotham to it's knees.

Todd Phillips dares to go where nobody ever wanted to with comic book villains. He has sympathy for the devil. To him, the Joker is a victim of circumstance, jaded and destroyed from a cruel world that has beaten him down one too many times. It's a role that demands tenderness from a sad and empty young man, and a breaking point that transforms him into a cesspool of senseless evil. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the greatest performance he's ever given here, in the greatest performance of 2019, and maybe even the decade itself. He breaks your heart and frightens you to the core. He portrays a genuinely real depiction of mental illness, that dares you into understanding it. Every last quivering bit of it. When he laughs, it doesn't feel maniacal and sinister. Instead, it sounds like a pained cry for help. A man completely helpless in controlling himself. You want to tear up just watching it. Yet, when he crosses into the dark side, all of that sympathy washes away, and in it's place comes loathing and fear. Fleck becomes an agent of chaos, with throngs of adoring fans at his feet. In other words, he finally became somebody.

Joker is centimeters from a perfect film. It would be, albeit, if you've never seen Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. It's impossible to watch this movie and overlook the clear as day tributes and similarities. Todd Phillips is a massive Scorsese fanboy. I've known that since War Dogs, which was an Iraq War copy of GoodFellas. In that sense, we aren't getting a uniquely original piece of work in the story behind Joker, and yet Phillips makes it work tremendously within the setting of the famous world of DC Comics. From there, recycled ideas become something new, and through a contemporary lens, this premise has been given a meaning to audiences as shocking now as Taxi Driver was then. Arthur is Travis Bickle, Rupert Pupkin and Howard Beale all rolled into one psychotic package.

Joker is no laughing matter. It's a landmark in comic book lore, and an important story to tell in film history. Believe the hype. Send in the clowns."
392,"I don't watch superhero movies, I have tried many times but by and large I find them largely superficial without any human depth to get my mind or emotions into. I am always on the look out for what is released though in the hope that better things are tried. And I was excited when Joker came out to see if something different was being tried. And oh my, how impressive. Such a radically brave move from DC to completely subvert all the genre expectations of superhero movies and to make an introspective film about one mans breakdown and descent into the dark. And what better man to play him than Joaquin Phoenix. An absolutely incredible character portrayal. Oscar well deserved. I am proud that such a bold risk from DC pulled off and despite the swathes of people who like cheap thrills (nothing wrong with that) that it disappointed, there are equal swathes that appreciated this take because it furthers our understanding of ourselves and humanity rather than being simple escapist entertainment. There is a place for the latter, but the former was sorely missing from the superhero franchises and this has laid down a new gauntlet."
393,"Give Joaquin Phoenix the Oscar right now. His bravura performance as the titular character in JOKER is one for the ages. He is on the screen in every scene of this film and captivates and repulses you at the same time. This performance raises this film to another level.

The question is - what level was this film at, and where does this performance raise it to?

Set in Gotham City right around the time of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents, JOKER tells the origin story of...well...a character that calls himself JOKER. This sad sack, with the name of Arthur Fleck, is a part-time clown (standing outside of store closings with a spinning sign or going to Children's Hospital). We watch his origins as he rises (or perhaps...falls?) to the anarchic symbol that is JOKER. And that's the interesting thing about this film. You are watching the fall of a man and the rise of a symbol - does Fleck find comfort or madness in this journey - or, perhaps, maybe he finds comfort in madness?

Embodying this broken spirit that keeps getting up despite whatever beatings (sometimes physical, sometimes mental, always with the potential to finally break him) is the unique talent that is Joaquin Phoenix. You can tell from his portrayal of Arthur that there is something just ""off"" with him and you continually wait for the breaking point that will drive him down the road of JOKER. But it is not only his acting that is on display here, it the manipulation and movements of his body that is amazing and outstanding. Much like a professional dancer, Phoenix/Fleck waltzes through this film like there is a musical score that only he can hear - and that is both fascinating and disturbing at the same time. There is a fine line that needs to be trod here, for if you don't, this character and performance can easily be one of total madness (a.k.a. Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance in the SHINING) but Phoenix balances sanity/insanity very well and you are waiting for the final blow that will send him, inevitably, over the edge. It's like watching a ticking time bomb that you cannot see the clock counting down to zero - but count down to zero you are sure it will do.

Exchanging blows with Phoenix for about 1/3 of this film is Robert DeNiro as talk show host Murray Franklin (think a meaner version of Johnny Carson). DeNiro is VERY good in this role and it is good to see that he still can ""bring it"" as a serious actor when he wants to. Unfortunately, DeNiro's character isn't really in the first 2/3 of this film and that's too bad. Phoenix' Arthur Fleck is a force to be reckoned with and he really could have used another character just as strong to play against.

Unfortunately, Writer/Director Todd Phillips (THE HANGOVER films) doesn't really give Phoenix anyone strong to play against for the first 2/3 of this film though Frances Conroy (overbearing mother), Zazie Beetz (potential love interest) and Brett Cullen (billionaire Thomas Wayne, father of Bruce) come and go in all too brief appearances that never really are on screen long enough to stand their ground (though Conroy comes close). This makes the first part of this film very on-sided, dreary, depressing and dark. I get that Director/Writer Phillips was going for the ""Decaying of Gotham"" theme as seen through the eyes of Fleck, but it became a slog after awhile. I wanted to yell at the screen at about the 1 hour mark ""All right, I get it!""

Now...to give Phillips credit, he creates an interesting version of this world that we all know well (through the Dark Knight and various other DC Universe films), so I give him points for originality. And...he really NAILS the ending (the last 1/3 of the film - the part WITH DeNiro). I thought it was effective and potent and left it's mark.

Which brings me back to my opening thought. Phoenix raises this film up with his performance - the question is ""from where to where"". I'd have to say (because of the slowness of the first 2/3 of this film) that Phoenix fearless performance raises this dark and dreary film from a ""C"" to a ""B"". So with that in mind, I give JOKER...

Letter Grade: B

7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
394,A truly exceptional film. How some 'critics' rated it so poorly highlights their irrelevance. The film deserves all the accolades that it has received. I cannot recommend this film highe enough.
397,"Labored through until the halfway point (over two days) and gave up. That's an hour of my life wasted. What a depressing, preachy pile of nonsense. I watch movies to be entertained and this movie didn't come close."
398,"You don't get to see this type of movie very often in theaters nowadays. And seeing almost 2,000 reviews two days after the movie had landed seems to support that opinion. What's the hype really about?

Here you have a tough movie detailing the life of a mentally unstable person living in a collapsing society. Does that seem like a movie which can create buzz? That looks, at least to me, like a movie made for narrower audience. But once you combine this setting with the Joker persona, you have something extraordinary with capacity to start debate and controversy. And we can ask ourselves why is that? Is it only because this movie hit cinemas at the right time detailing delicate themes of modern era? Or is there something peculiar in combining Joker and prevailing illness and loneliness?

Many people have already rightly pointed out similarities between Joker and Scorsese's Taxi Driver. In both cases we are following stories of mentally sick man surrounded by awful conditions. Manner in which the topic is dealt with is similar as well: very graphic and open. But here similarities stop. These are two very different movies having totally different objectives.

First, Taxi Driver elaborates on a guy having some sort of superiority complex and problematic, if not even sick, approach to women (madonna-wh**e complex from Freudian psychology). Joker gives us insight into a person who has been bullied, underestimated and made use off his entire life. Plus, everybody knows who Joker really is. He's crazy, enigmatic, smart and influential.

This knowledge takes us additionally into entirely different direction since in Taxi Driver we couldn't really tell with high confidence what's going to happen with Travis. That's the brilliance of Taxi Driver. It tricks you and makes you guess since Travis seems to think and act pretty sound but still showing signs of deteriorating mind. Brilliance of Joker is that the guy who is to become Joker, *undoubtedly* mentally unstable and violent, doesn't trick us like Travis but makes us sympathize showing his side of the story.

Joker is thus more than a story about an underdog. I'd say, contrary to popular opinion, that Joker is more a social commentary than a character study. For a movie to be a character study we'd have to see more description of characters inner dynamics (Travis writing his diaries in Taxi Driver). Besides, Joker is who he is because he is socially very relevant. He's got followers and has become an idea. What we're really witnessing is *not* underdog becoming a winner but society collapsing and loosing its way. Joker is a winner only because society became a loser.

So there's really nothing to admire about Joker. I personally look at him as a sign of what might happen to a society of individuals in which:

""Everybody yells and screams to each other. Nobody is civil anymore. Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy. ""

And that is why I see this movie as a great social commentary, especially during times in which entire world has been struck by tragedies, horrors and mutual distrust."
399,"Watching this movie is an experience. A breathtaking, horrible, dark, depressing, powerful experience.

It's a classic in my books."
400,"There have been many a Joker - from live action adaptations and animated adaptations - and this one, by Joaquin Phoenix, is the best one next to Heath Ledger's Joker. With this film released late in the year, perhaps Phoenix is a shoo-in for Best Actor. An excellent character study of a man battling a plethora of mental illnesses. Also, for those who have seen this movie, one question remains: How much of the movie is rooted in reality, and how much of it is in Arthur Fleck's mind? It's difficult to differentiate reality from fantasy."
401,"Amazing! Amazing! Brilliant acting, fantastic scrip and this will keep you captivated throughout. The best film I've seen in years. Thought provoking too about mental health which is a good thing but if you don't look beyond the film itself for any reasoning behind his downfall it's just a fantastic piece of work."
402,"Joker a film about Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and his struggle through life, and also his birth into the Joker. The film is a disturbing and tragic yet you cannot take your eyes off the film. The music score was fantastic and The acting was absolutely superb. I highly recommend this film!"
403,"Joaquin Phoenix is such a talented actor. Dark movie, but you will with no doubt be mesmerized by Joaquin's performance."
405,"This dark film was something that I knew I'd see but maybe I'd wait til streaming release but without something to do on Halloween I took myself to movies.

I did not read any reviews but as I sat in cinema watching every last credit scroll up the only word that seemed fitting was Masterpiece. It seems that's a word common to describe this.

The frail and yet emotionally powerful physicality of Phoenix captivates and unsettles throughout.

The clever weaving of different characters' storylines in this origin tale makes complete sense and nothing feels contrived. Whether or not (perhaps especially if you are not) a fan of superhero blockbusters this film should draw you in and haunt you.

Much food for thought on how society deals with difference,...not paying lip service to it..the innocence of Frankenstein, grotesque and wanting love and acceptance in a cruel world definitely echoes in this universal story.

I recommend to anyone who likes to be moved not just entertained.."
407,"Joaquin Phoenix' performance: A

Rest of the movie as a whole: D

Total: C

Some will love it, some will hate it. I'm somewhere in the middle."
408,"A very successful introduction of a character. We can see the type of person joker is, and the problems he had to go through by all the emotions shown. Thanks to Joaquin Phoenix who definitely deserved that maiden Oscar for a hell of performance. He is a great joker. This film is a must to watch!"
409,"This movie is a reflection of America. About how there are winners and losers in the game of life and how some people realize their spot in the loser category and lash out with nothing to lose. It creates a hero out of a bottom feeder and gives hope to those who aren't part of the privileged elite. Beyond the plot this movie has one of the best acting performances I've seen in years in Joaquin Phoenix. I've heard he was an absolute pill on set and it's obvious that his weight loss had to have been very tough to pull off. I want a sequel but I know it could never live up to this, now one of my favorite movies of all time. That's saying a lot coming from someone who hates the super hero genre. This movie doesn't fit that mold. It gives actual plausible explanations for the Joker origin story. It makes you want to understand where he's coming from and why he ultimately turned into a monster. Unfortunately I think a lot of us can sympathize with his character."
410,The hype was real and the movie was a modern masterpiece. Even though it feelt more as a movie about a man falling into madness that a Joker movie but nonetheless I can 100% recommend watching this movie for Joker fans or Joaquin Phoenix fans (who really challanged Heath Ledger in role of Joker but in other aspects that you think). In conclusion an amazing movie to watch.
411,"Todd Phillips (The Hangover guy) wrote, produced and directed this origin story for the Joker character from DC Comics 'Batman.' It features a powerhouse performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a clown for hire by day, and a wannabe stand up comedian at night. Suffering from a medical condition that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times, Arthur finds that the joke always seems to be on him. Caught in a cynical existence between apathy and cruelty, he makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study. Phillips's film is a rare beast, a comic book movie which non comic book fans will probably appreciate more. It pays tribute to the 1970's and early 80's films of Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro (who appears here as a manipulative TV chat show host), particularly King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. Hildur Guðnadóttir composed the the film's score, which she wrote simultaneously alongside the music for the TV miniseries Chernobyl. As well as original music, it features the songs ""That's Life"", ""Send In the Clowns"", ""White Room,"" and controversially, ""Rock and Roll Part 2,"" by convicted child sex offender Gary Glitter (who did not receive a penny In royalties)"
412,"Well this was brilliantly done,

what can i say the movie is such a tragic story that as you mind blown away in the finals minutes of the end. the sadness of one human life so tragically intense but yet so psychotic very well put together and very well acted.

This leaves you wonder by the end how much of that was in his mind and how much was real.

over the last decade DC and Marvel have had too many pretty boys to play pretty parts and had way to much CGI and Photoshop

what we have here was a raw character played and played without any facades

#JoaquinPhoenix did this movie justice he created something bigger than the writer ever anticipated , now he has raised the bar they need ( the writers) to deliver the sequel"
413,"Out of this whole year I have never watched a movie that played with my emotions quite like this film. Joker is a character study on one of the most famous villains in the dc comics but this film is not what you expect. It's more of a story of a man who has a mental illness and just keeps going to the more extreme side of insanity. This movie does that so well and Joaquin Phoenix has one of the best performances of this year and deserves on Oscar. Robert De Niro, though having a small role, has an amazing performance as well. The story is very much inspired from taxi driver but is very different as well. This is a much watch movie for any person comic fan or not. MUST WATCH AMAZING MOVIE!!!!"
414,"This is a very different movie from Endgame, so stop the comparisons. If you must compare it to something, compare it to other movies with Joker in it. Nicholson, Ledger, Leto, that's all fine and good. But do not compare it to something that is a different context. If you must compare to a Marvel product, then how bout Logan...if you must. That's even a stretch. Comparing it to the other just shows how biased you are towards DC and or Marvel. Just give your observation and leave it at that. No comparison needed. It should be able to stand or fall on it's own merit alone."
415,"I'm a huge fan of Joaquin Phoenix. I couldn't wait to see this movie.

Afterwards I found the movie to be very good. But as the hours were going by, I became gradually less and less enthustiastic.

Because Joaquin Phoenix tries too hard. He's bigger than the movie. And that's a sin. His extreme weight loss, his acting are too much, as if he were saying ""do you see what a performance I'm putting in?"".

I give it a 6 because of that.

Heath Ledger was much more impressive as a Joker imo. We couldn't help noticing how great he was playing that character but it wasn't overbearing."
416,Its not often I sit through a movie not realising how long it's been going for. This movie finished and I thought there was another hour to go. Really good character progression. Awsome acting. I hope there is a second one!
417,"In a crumbling Gotham City, where the government has simply given up, failed clown Joaquin Phoenix goes from loser to an acclaimed clown vigilante.

This movie is about the creation and rise of Batman villain The Joker. It draws on the societal collapse of the 1970s and 1980s, with references to Bernie Goetz, Robert De Niro present to make the audience think of TAXI DRIVER and his failed and insane comic in THE KING OF COMEDY. It could have been a reference to lend a veneer of cinematic respectability to this movie. Comic books arose, lazily repurposing shards of popular culture for an audience too young to recognize them for what they were, during the depths of the Depression. It was a time that led people to believe that society was in inevitable collapse; large swaths of the 2019 audience believed the same. It could have been obvious and cheap, except for all the trash in the street and Phoenix's committed performance. As it is, with the 1980s standing in for society today, society in the 1930s... Batman is not even present, just his father (who might be Phoenix's father also; emphasizing the duality that keeps being imposed on the relationship), who, it is implied, could do something, but doesn't.... well, it's a thoroughly unlikable and well made movie. Just because I don't like the message, I don't insist on shooting the messenger, even though I've heard this message many times. So the implication is that it's been ignored, and will keep being repeated until attention is paid.

If only it didn't glory in the dirt and destruction."
418,"Make everyone into pricks and jerks towards a clown because he'll become one of the deadliest batman villains of all time.

Bedaaaaboring!

From the getgo everyone was being jerks. That's not the main problem. It's just the movie lacked dept. People are jerks to Arthur and he reacts. People are jerks and Arthur reacts. That was the whole movie.

Everyone that Arthur interacts with are pricks to him. With the exception to the sick children there was not one person that had a positive relationship with Arthur.

This movie is evidence that anyone can make a billion dollar movie as of 2019.

Lastly the movie never really starts. Once the movie gets interesting. The credits roll."
419,Just watch it. Disclaimer this movie is not for everybody.
420,"Ignore these haters, trust me. They're extremely biased and are simply hating this movie because people like it and because they expect it to be something that it isn't.

Things you MUST know before you watch the movie is that this isn't a ""Batman"" movie. It's not an action movie. If you're expecting a ton of action and explosions and a lot happening then this isn't the right movie for you.

This movie is a drama. It's a drama about a man named Arthur and how he became ""Joker."" It doesn't really go into details or explore his childhood. The movie is about a very small portion of Arthur's life that happened just right up to before he becomes ""Joker."" The premise is pretty simple and not overly complicated.

The reason this movie is loved is because it's beautifully shot and executed. The acting is superb, the cinematography is beautiful, the score is chilling, the art and flow is very poetic. This is not a movie you watch with your eyes. This is a movie that you must watch with your mind. It goes deep into the human psyche. It presents simple things in a different light. It dances, literally AND figuratively between light and dark, good and bad, right and wrong. You have to pay attention or you'll miss the message.

I enjoyed the movie and I believe it's a type of movie that requires multiple viewings to get the full experience. There's a lot of subtle details that are easily missed even if you pay attention."

422,"Todd Phillips JOKER tale is fantastic! Well written, blend of Taxi Driver and The Killing Joke if you ask me. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar nod for his portrayal. Those of us from the Bronx will see and recognize a lot of our neighborhoods as it becomes the new Gotham. Can't say enough about how much I loved the direction Todd Phillips took in giving us a different take on the Batman/Joker storyline."
423,Do I have to say more? It's everything I thought it would be. This is the best movie of 2019.
424,"Not as disturbing as people claimed, expected more but nonetheless, a wonderful movie well written and acted, now part of my collection👌🏾"
425,"From the director of ""The Hangover"" trilogy comes a dark and gritty version of Joker's origin story. His version of the Joker seems to be heavily inspired by Martin Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy"" with a touch of ""Taxi Driver"". On top of that, there are some attempts of commentary about society and how crooked it is. When you mix all those things up, you get a film that's going to divide everyone's opinions.

Let's begin with the good stuff first. Easily, the best part of the film was a performance by Joaquin Phoenix. He carried this film completely and he gave one of the better performances of his career (nothing is going to beat his performance in ""The Master""). He proved once again why he's one of the best actors working today. If someone else was in his place, there's no way this film would've worked. His mannerisms, facial expressions (especially how he showed so many different emotions through laughs and eye expressions at the same time), his physicality and his vulnerability were incredible. If this film received a bit better reviews he would definitely be the main contender for that Oscar. Furthermore, the next aspect with which I was blown away was the score. I would even say that the score was a more effective way of showing emotions than the script. Because of the score at every moment, you knew how you were supposed to feel regarding what's happening on the screen, and that was achieved in a way that wasn't forceful. If you listen carefully to the score, you can even distinguish what scenes happened in reality and which were just in his imagination. Those two aspects of the film were outstanding and they carried the film noticeably. The color palette really nicely supported the script. Through the colors in the film, you could've seen in what mood the main character was and how he felt about what was happening around him. Colors helped to immerse the audience into that time period (I would say the film happened in 1981 because the movie theatre was showing the film ""Blow Out"" which came out in that year), but that wouldn't work without production design which was on the point. The cinematography was decent. Although the director's vision wasn't groundbreaking I generally enjoyed most of the camera choices.

Let's get into some aspects that weren't so good. The script. It's one of the weakest parts of the film. You get a feeling the film wanted to say a lot, but unfortunately, it ended up saying almost nothing. There were a lot of attempts to give some social commentary, but for me personally, that fell flat because there wasn't any explanation of why is everything how it is. Joker as a character for the huge part of the film was complaining about how society is bad and how everyone is mean, but there wasn't any reason given why is the world like that, beyond poverty and poor people suck and rich people are corrupted and evil. Regarding that specific aspect, I felt like the director wanted to say a lot, but it just ended up being shallow and on the nose. The film was beating you over the head of how everything is bad. I would've appreciated concluding by myself that the world is crooked, but instead, I was just told what the situation was, without any room for my own interpretations. And that explained situation wasn't backed up with any other pieces of information. This time, tell don't show approach didn't work out. Furthermore, speaking of the script, all characters except Joker were unbelievable and underwritten. Zazie Beetz was completely unutilized and the relationship between her character and the Joker was underdeveloped. The film was supposed to make you believe in their relationship, but it didn't and because of it the film suffered at the later stages of its runtime. I understood what did film tried to achieve with their relationship, but that wasn't realized very well. That sentence could've been used for many aspects of this film. Robert De Niro as an older version of Rupert Pupkin had a ton of fun in this film, one of the better De Niro's performances since ""Casino"". They could've done more with his character, but at least it seemed like he had fun with this project. So, Joker is basically the only character that was decently written, but the thing is, the director didn't make a clear choice if we were supposed to feel for him or we were supposed to hate him because of his actions. Don't get me wrong, he isn't a good person, but the film way too many times tried to make the audience sympathize with him. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but at the times it felt way too forceful.

In the end, looking at the whole picture, this is a good film but isn't anything spectacular. At the same time, I would say the film was overblown with praises of how good it was, and yet at the same time, it was unfairly criticized because of some aspects in the film (e.g. the usage of violence)."
426,The acting by JP is phenomenal but the disappointment from the movie is that that's the only thing to watch. Now you can understand that even Heath Ledger needed a Nolan and a Zimmer and Howard combo to make it legendary.
430,"Excellent movie to watch, Joaquin Phoenix's acting is phenomenal."
431,"This was among the top 5 movies I've ever seen. I found joaquins performance both entertaining and disturbing. On the one hand, you're laughing at his social ineptitude, saying ""oh that joker, always trying to fit in"" but as the plot unfolds, you find yourself picking your jaw up off the ground. And the camera work, it just accents his amazing performance. Someone said this movie spiraled from start to finish and they were not kidding. If he doesn't win the Oscar for this, then the academy is a waste of time."
432,You never seen anything like this Joaquin shines so bright that you would be amazed of how great he is in this movie everything about this movie is perfect i promise.
433,"Joaquin Phoenix transform to the joker Best actor in 2019

Amazing ending and no stupid girl clown to ruined the movie hope for joker 2"
434,"... Joker ... - From a DC Comic book: is a grandiose movie if there is one, produced in a sensational way by ""Todd Phillips"" who knew how to make an incredibly realistic human impact, without ever taking lose sight of this vision of a sick society, which despises and destroys the most vulnerable, and simply lets appear a deep evil lurking in the shadows and which feeds on the vulnerability of a growing class of the most humble of our society, which acts like a poison that slowly infuses to end up intoxicating a society that is losing more and more of all these benchmarks.
The movie is brought to the zenith by the exceptional performance of Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) who bursts the screen from the first to the last frame, giving even more power to this exceptional movie. Be careful, our society is sick and like cancer it infects the cogs of our society, which one wonders how ... it does not even realize it today."
435,"I won't say much because it might ruin it for others but I can safely say this is one of my favourite movies of all-time and only once before have I given a movie 10 stars and that was ""Saving Private Ryan"". It will be criminal if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win Best Actor at the Academy Awards and this movie has to win Best Movie. I've already watched it twice. The plot and the acting are second to none. I just can't get over how good it was. Hopefully a sequel is in the works. There is so much they could do with this character and this story."
436,"That was a really interesting take on one of the most popular characters in comic book history and I really liked it. One of the most realistic and darkest DC flims I have seen..

Very good story that has emotional emphasis and has fantastic worldbuilding exposition (Gotham City) but a slow pacing. Great music composition and visuals. Impressive acting and writing. Lastly brillaint directing!

Overall a very enjoyable movie. But tbh this might be a hit or miss for most people. If they can relate to it or understand it they will enjoy it but if you hate slow pacing and senseless violence then this might not be the movie...

Memorable: Sort of Rewatchable: Yes"
437,"As strange a film as you will see, for some this may be a Monet of the film world, but weird is not always wonderful. For myself the film was Ok, I felt the story lacked credibility at times, as a piece of cinematography is will stand up, but the story will not be for everyone."
438,"Wawooooooooo! Not an easy one, but, again, wawooooooooo!!!

A true masterpiece on all parameters:

Acting, story, directing, music.

A very strong and troubling spiritual and social message too...

So for the last time - wawooooooooo!"
439,"The Joker is a wild ride thru the waves of mental illness. Joaguin Phoenix delivers a powerful portrayal of Arthur Fleck's journey from simple man into the powerful Joker, or at least, the beginning of him.

The movie is appropriately dark with many scenes in close, dark quarters. Very little light is shed on Arthur. As the movie progresses and he gets beaten up by the world bit by bit, he tries to use comedy and laughter to make his way thru. But soon you learn, thru flashbacks, that all is not quite as it seems in his world. You start to wonder what is delusion and what is reality.

I had hoped for a little more of Batman's beginnings here, but no, you only get a glimpse into the murder of the Waynes and of young Bruce. The focus is squarely on the Joker.

I found the tie-in to the TV show announcer Murray, played by DeNiro, as a bit of a stretch. Arthur really admired DeNiro's talk show and dreams of being on his show. Well, watch out what you dream for because in Joker's world, there is a very thin wall between dream and reality, often with shocking results.

Gotham City always seems perched on the edge of anarchy, and it's never clear why, but, so be it. When the Joker's message of a clown starts to gain traction with the masses, there's a tidal shift of popularity towards Fleck, which he leverages to start emerging into his character as a full-time reality.

The story is pretty depressing. It shows the power of mental illness, and certain scenes made me think of the movie The Secret Garden. With mental illness, it seems you never know what is going to happen, and that certainly is what played out in this movie.

The Joker is a hard movie to watch. Be prepared for brutal scenes. But then again, suffering from mental illness must not be a pretty thing to experience, so the movie does it justice by showing you just how messy it can be. Enjoy if you dare."
440,"Joker is anything but a masterpiece, although it certainly takes itself seriously enough and it tries harder than any movie in recent memory to be one (maybe the recent Star is Born tries harder). But I found it largely languorous, psychopathic in its intent and subsequent failure to move me on any level and, well, not worth even a laugh.

I don't know what the point of this film is, since it doesn't really work as Batman lore, providing a shoddy psychological construct around the Joker's origins, and if the idea was to top either Nicholson or Ledger it failed me (Nolan's Joker vision is far more nihilistic, seemingly coming from nowhere, with a twisted, brutal sense of humor about him.) Here we are meant to empathize with poor disgruntled Arthur Fleck, which might have been easier had he not been fed so many obvious motivations for his disgruntlement, and propped up by such lazy writing.

If Joker is meant to 'be a mirror' to our times, it fails again, to say anything relevant or novel about society, or about the US, or the mental health system or anything really that hasn't been said a million times before, and instead seems focused on taking itself really really seriously, and wants us to find sequences of the Joker dancing to Gary Glitter edgy and bombastic, when really these sequences are dull and incongruent deadweight.

Fans will lambast the haters of this film, but frankly I was bored by its flat embrace of pointless amorality. I wanted better, more biting satire, more layers, more motivation. Instead we get superficial, ultra-violent and pointless dreck which says and means nothing, even while it looks swell, has a great cast and seemingly all the ingredients are in order. But maybe that's the trade off for giving the reigns of such a film to the Hangover director."
441,This truly was a perfect film. Joaquin Phoenix takes the audience on a journey into madness. Phoenix puts on one of the best performances I've ever seen in movie history. It really felt like you were witnessing a man go insane. I had high expectations for this and it did not disappoint!
442,"I can say that i'm really grateful that movies like this one haven't died yet. I waited so long for this movie, wishing not to be bad one. I went to the theater with so much hope because of the reviews here. I finished the movie in completely silence.. i really thought that i should see it again even though it was 2 am. I never really had this kind of feeling since interstellar. It's a masterpiece.. everything excellent and has been done with passion. Thanks Joaquin And Tod for this movie. I'm SPEECHLESS. It's pure drama my friends just don't miss it go and watch it and put on a happy face, or silent one i could say."
443,"It makes you feel like you could have gone down the wrong path and empathize with him. There are a ton of would be jokers out there who have been tormented day in and day out, and now you see what happens when one of them has had enough. I used to think Joker was a psychopath. Hardly! He's simply a mentally ill (borderline personality disorder and schizophrenic ) person pushed to the edge. This could almost serve as a foretelling of what could truly happen if we don't try to help people now, who go through this kind of abuse."
446,"This movie is scary, but not in the way you think. It reaches deep inside your head, and will make you question what is happening. This movie will make you feel strange. The acting is great, the cinematography is great, and the story, it's nuts. The whole viewing experience is surreal and it'll feel like a dream afterwards. I like this movie for the way it can manipulate you to feel these things, and it's like the Space Odyssey of this generation."
447,"""Joker"" (2019) written and directed by Todd Phillip and staring Joaquin Phoenix was perhaps one of 2019's most anticipated and marketed films. Because of popular culture having spoken of the film, I felt like I consciously had to reset my expectations of the film.

Two things stood out to me, both trademarks of perfection in ""Joker""; the first being Phoenix' performance, who delivered an incredible and visceral performance of one of comic history's most revered criminals. The sheer grit and panic that he conveyed to the screen was nothing short of breathtaking to witness.

Second, Phillips' direction was supreme. The directional choices I thought were particularly intelligent; from a great alternate beginning in terms of identifying the audience with Arthur Fleck, to its excellent pacing and storytelling ability.

Apart from these two obvious qualities, it was indeed a fine film experience. But overrated? In my opinion, definitely so. Worthy of top 25? 50? 100? Not in my book.

Highly recommended, nonetheless."
448,"JP is the best actor of his generation,and this movie has everything you ever wanted in a movie, RIP Marvel Avengers ,maybe endgame made more money ,but Joker rules everything else."
449,"Despite supreme acting the movie itself is not very entertaining, which leaves those of us who don't find the joker as a particularly interesting character disenchanted in a boring and dull Gotham as a mere background.

I wish the clown was at least funny. Go Batman!"
450,I like Joakin Phoenix but his performance wasn't Oscar worth like Heath Ledger! The movie wasn't bad and the acting wasn't bad but this writer turned this into a slow joke with this music! I can see why people got upset about the mental ill aspect of this movie but a person with a mental illness pushed to the edge! It didn't stink but it could've been better and I wish it had been!
451,"I was so hype after the trailer, and kinda expecting to be disappointed because DC you khow... but well it turn out even better than what the trailer had shown, and im grad its. The acting in this movie is too good, hat off to the new joker Joaquin Phoenix. He deserved an oscar for this act. The story line is still kinda classic joker's but its darker and a lot more twist, i cant count how many time i almost jump off my sit by suprise and excitement. And there is sooo many dark joke... i love it."
452,"This movie is a cinematic piece of art that must not be missed!

People complaining that it was drawn out and had no plot are completely missing the point of the movie. It was a psychological analysis of a diathesis stress illness, namely schizophrenia. A man's decent into darkness after a childhood of abuse. It wasn't meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster with fast cars and CGI fighting rubbish.

It was utterly necessary to have the elongated beginning, otherwise the brilliant cinematography and score at the conclusion would not have been so impactful.

Phoenix, as usual, gave us a masterclass in acting. He lived every tiny schizophrenic moment of Fleck's mind and played it to perfection. If he doesn't win the Oscar this time, I swear I'll never watch it again!

For me, this is the movie of the decade. I rarely see a movie twice, but I'm going back for this one a second time. 10 stars."
453,"The joker is real amazing, real greatest movie!!! Just great!!!"
454,"I saw Joker with the wife in Spain. It's really difficult to get her to the movies since she's more of a horror movie (they call it terror films in Spain) buff but she was excited for Joker.

We both loved it. I felt really bad for Arthur Fleck during the movie and the wife and I cringed at the comedy scene. One thing I found interesting is that when you see his card and his notebook, they filmed it in Spanish for its Spanish audience.

Throughout the movie, it was hard to figure out if he's imagining certain scenes or not. Early on he imagines himself on the Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) Show and this establishes that he develops things in his mind.

By the time of his transformation, you pretty much feel for the guy despite the criminal acts he has done. The film does a 180 at the end and changes your perspective of the whole film. This movie is brilliant."
455,"Joker

The Joker is similar to the DC Joker character but is not a criminal genius.

The movie was a great depiction of how a person who has been mistreated, lied to, and ignored, totally lacking access to human compassion, can snap.

The acting is top notch, the plot follows the journey of a mind into madness. Not only that, but it makes a statement about the society we live in. There are some really good plot twists and thought-provoking moments here that will prompt self-inspection.

It puts a spotlight on the importance of addressing mental health issues in modern times.

I highly recommend seeing this movie, and not for the comic book tie-in, either. This movie stands on its own and didn't need the context of a comic book character to get it's message across."
456,Acting 10/10 plot 10/10 cinematography 10/10 why this movie 8.4/10? Its so underrated movie.
457,"I thought it was a good film but certainly didn't think it was a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix does deserve praise for his acting as it really was excellent and the script was well thought out but it also was quite flat for long periods. I was hoping for a little more, especially after seeing all of the reviews, which is never a good thing as you go into it almost demanding it's perfection. I gave it a 7 because it was well made and acted but if anyone else was the star man, I mean an unknown actor without all of the hype, this film MIGHT not get the same recognition as it did."
458,"The reason I gave JOKER a 10 out of 10 is that 11 wasn't an option. Phoenix's performance is outstanding. He brought an iconic character on screen in the most perfect style and he made me feel like I could finally see the real Joker from the comic books translated in the flesh. The subtleties and the nuances of his gestures are moving. I could not believe what my eyes were seeing. No offence to the other past attempts, but they do not go anywhere near this. Everything in this masterpiece is absolute perfection from the beginning to the end. It's believable. It's technically spotless. It fits our times and the commentary on society is spot on."
459,"any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.


the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this ""madness"" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.


the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.








Bottom line, don't think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....

Oh and the ""joker laugh""....lets just say, it was also poor."
461,"Well he deserves an Oscar for this. It's very dark so not for everyone but the acting, filming & other details were so well done. Towards the end I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching Heath Ledger... an amazing homage paid to him. I'm sure he's smiling somewhere. Obviously it's fiction but shows the progression of how this could happen & does happen to people every day, the struggles they face with funding cuts etc. I loved this movie & felt so sorry for the joker despite the horrendous things he became capable of. Bravo👏🏻"
462,"This movie is literally AMAZING!!! It not only have meaning and reason behind every camera shot and placement, but it has poetic meaning, plot twists, and tells a story of modern society and its influence on others.

It is not only a great movie for those reasons, but it is also VERY entertaining and enjoyable, and isn't like the Godfather or something where a lot of people struggle to not be bored. This movie is literally enjoyable for anyone who doesn't mind the gore or disturbing mental state Author is going through. Really shows how a character like The Joker could become...well...THE JOKER!!!"
463,"I came into the theater expecting to be a bit disappointed. Seeing people in droves rate this movie as a masterpiece made me think this would be another overblown DC flick but my low expectations were put to shame. This is a film that is unlike anything i have seen in the past years. This is a visceral, haunting film that will be very difficult to forget. My eyes were practically glued to the screen. I didn't want to miss a single detail. Seeing Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Clown Prince of Gotham is downright masterful. I cannot recall character development done so effectively, yet realistically. You comprehend Fleck's motives, even if you don't agree with the harsh extent to which he takes them. You see how society could craft such an individual. How our society could isolate and destroy an Arthur Fleck. Although Fleck has mental issues, within the first half of the film he wishes to cause no harm and only wants to follow his dream to make people laugh. Of course the majority of credit has to go to Joaquin Phoenix. His work is tremendous. The laugh, the mannerisms. Phoenix portrays Fleck like a real person. A tormented person who has received much trauma over his life, and how a series of unfortunate events finally cause him to snap. How he tried to smile through the pain until the pain made him smile. It's a brilliant performance that deserves every award across the board. I never thought someone could come close to Ledger's work, but Phoenix possibly surpasses Ledger. I could go into great detail about the terrific music choices, the score, the cinematography which captures Gotham oh so well, the directing, and even De Niro's work. Everything clicked. There's no false not. It built to a such a powerful climax i had goosebumps among a crowded theater. This is a decade defining film, and one unlike anything you'll see again in quite some time. Let's hope the Oscars do the right thing."
464,"This movie, this actor and overall execution was superb.

Illness of the society is impecable pictured. This movie should be discussed to Annalise the cancer of our modern society"
465,"The joker film by Todd Phillips, is a great depiction of the famed DC villain. It added a twist unlike any joker film ever scene. The take on the character and the astonishing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, gave us a joker that we have wanted since Heath ledger. I really hope DC can develop a story that keeps the characters going in a series that we will enjoy!"
466,"I'll leave all the glossy remarks to the paid critics.

I simply want to say that seldom have I been so riveted by a performance as I was last night.

I'm primarily a comic Fan, long term too. Most adaptions are less than rubbish. This is excellent. Phoenix is Oscar worthy and the production is terrific.

Being set in the past removes the over abundance of tech and gadgets which suits the character and the myth. It also allows the actors and the words to shine.

The photography, the music (wow) and the supporting cast was flawless.

So pleased it's still possible to make a movie like this."
468,"Funny guy Todd Phillips of Hangover fame gives up comedy because of the ""woke"" culture and creates a masterpiece in the process. The movie works perfectly even w/o any knowledge of the Batman universe. Joachim Phoenix should have his Oscar guaranteed."
469,"Phoenix should rightly get an oscar nomination for his portrayal of the joker.

This film did not have enough 'story' from the fictional world of the joker and batman and villainy in Gotham city.

Instead it focused on a disturbingly realistic and harrowing portrayal of mental illness.

In films we like are badies to be bad, and be evil, and to be fictional. We go to the movies to escape real life.

Instead Phoenix's vivid portrayal of mental illness and the films focusing so heavily on it. Made it too disturbing and horrifically life like to be enjoyable.

Phoenix has showed his amazing talent as an actor the films mistake was in exposing the audience too much too it."
470,"Shoddily written, sloppily directed, this movie steals from both Taxi Driver & King of Comedy but dishonors both. It seems we live in an era that glorifies & wallows in self-pity & boy does this movie nurture that."
471,"Joker (2019)

9.5/10🤡🎭💄

""Dark, violent and so full of truth, Joker takes a new approach on the backstory trope, creating a very grand accomplishment of a film that will go down as one of the greats of all time.""

The societal factors that surround us are what shape the everyday lives of any man or woman that walks the ground of the earth. Joker just so happens to be glorius yet horrifyingly realistic depiticion of the various ""what ifs"" in our dysfunctional world. Granted, this film is a origin story of one of the most beloved antagonists in cinema and comic book history, however, the film also holds a very vital meaning in its delivery. With the help of a Joaquin Phoenix career defining performance, we are able to see the slow dip into insanity of the average man who'd be the least expected to morph into a monstrous villain by the hand of society, caused by neglection. Todd Phillips is a damn genius, and again proves to us that a comedic mind can also hold the most grim ideas. He most certainly proves this by delivering the fun additives, which would be the clever use of violence that is more artsy than controversial (people exaggerate so much it sickens me), a discomforting atmosphere that leaves you feeling the anxiety you never knew you could feel; like watching Taxi Driver times 5, and an ending that you never knew a third act could pull off so masterfully, it becomes more unforgettable than one could imagine. Joker has easily, and most effortlessly, claimed the throne of Movie of the Year.

Verdict: Joker is the masterpiece we all knew it would be. Even if the Clown Prince of Crime isn't your cup of tea, I suggest watching this movie anyways because it's not just a movie, it's a reality."
472,"All I loved about this movie was because of Joaquin. He did an amazing work, he collaborated to the ambience. This movie reflects a very sympathetic Joker wherw put you as a viewer between the debate of feeling bad for him or not, the cruel and dark scenes are very entertaining and kept me with my mouth wide open the entire film. I liked it a lot."
473,"Joker is a phenomenal symphony of film leading up to a breathtaking crescendo.

Joaquin Phoenix absolutely outdoes himself. I didn't see him in ""Her"" or ""The Master"", but knew he was special after ""Gladiator"" and ""Walk The Line"" - and his 2010 year-long performance-art piece ""I'm Still Here"" cemented him as a modern acting great. He was just as spellbinding with this interpretation of the most famous comic book villain of all time. Arguably his best work to date.

But an actor can't be great without great material. And what (surprisingly) Todd Phillips has done with Joker is nothing short of genius. Not only has Phillips achieved what so few comedy film-makers do by crossing over into the provocative dramatic genre, he has produced a true masterpiece of movie material.

Not for the faint hearted. It is disturbing at times. A result Phillips and his team set out to achieve, citing that violence has become too socially accepted in our media. We shrug it off and accept it as part of our entertainment, but with Joker he has made what violence is: Disturbing. Deeply uncomfortable. Painful. He makes the audience feel. An outcome very few mainstream film-makers achieve these days.

The film is aptly titled. It is about absolutely no-one else other than its subject. Every character is simply crafted to present the film's focus: Joker. A deeply injured member of society who succumbs to his pain.

Masterful film-making in a world drowning in a sea of meaningless media. Todd Phillips selected the best of the best to paint his picture. The strangely haunting score (which fit perfectly into Phillips' world), the perfectly presented cinematography, the costume and set design, the acting, the editing (sound and film!), all masterfully mixed into one of the pieces of the year.

While it's unlikely Joker will walk away with Best Picture, don't be surprised if it gets a nomination. Plus a host of other category noms.

It's not for everyone. But for this sociological ponderer, it was almost perfect."
474,The plot could've been a little more defined BUT Joaquin is phenomenal. Flawlessly done. He deserves every award possible for his performance.
475,"Phenomenal performance I love the DC Comics and this movie is dark and gritty even disturbing at times this movie had me glued to the screen it's that good I didn't want it to end I cant wait for the follow up and apparently the Batman will be introduced and if its has dark has the Joker it will be amazing.

10 stars"
476,"DC does it again! Great movie! Good acting, cinematography, plot, etc. All around awesome!"
477,"Joker did not provide all the glitz, excitement and action that most superhero/Marvel/DC films tend to have, what it did have is the backstory on the Joker. The intro to his meeting Batman as a child, laying groundwork for the future of the two. I appreciate a film that can cause the viewer to have empathy for the villain and this one did just that. Phenomenal acting by Joaquin Pheonix. He was cast perfectly as he puts his all into all of his work and superbly played the Joker. All in all a well enjoyed film that leaves me looking for the next."
478,"There is not one single meaningless or bad scene in this whole movie. The full way through you are gripping the edge of you're chair. The writing, directing and acting all combine to give this spectacular movie. It shows how mistreating someone, even just slightly, can really send them over the edge and into complete insanity. Joaquins performance really sells the characters delusion and can be really frightening at points. I also love how the film doesn't hold back on how violent and dark it can be, it breaks the guidelines and limits of what films should be. A complete redoing of the joker, making his laughing a physical disability is such a strong idea that is portrayed so incredibly well. I love how Batman's origin was also tied in to the movie, it works so well and gives an interesting reaction to any superhero fan. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys movies even slightly. 10/10 beware if you are sensitive :)"
479,I couldn't find a negative thing about this movie. It's bold and brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I have ever seen. You have to go and see this. The only reason it has negative reviews is because some people were expecting another superhero movie with action - thank god it's not.
480,"SYNOPSIS: Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect (condition that causes you to laugh uncontrollably) and is seen as an outcast of society. He's trying to make it as a stand-up comedian, but after one violent incident he becomes a psychopathic murderer.

REVIEW: This is a very dark film that really works in so many ways. I didn't connect all the way with the film, however. At times the film very much drags and I actually liked it a little less on a second viewing. POSITIVES: The directing and cinematography in this film were next level. So many stellar shots and Todd Phillips really captures the essence of Gotham and how that world is. The color palette of the film gives real emotion to the atmosphere. Starting as a warmer and blurred vision while Arthur was an innocent man trying his best to move along And then the transition to a colder blue and clarity when he starts to turn and stay off his meds indicating a misguided idea of clarity while off of his medication. I loved the divide in classes in this film showing how those in poverty are seen as more chaotic and less important. This commentary is so true when you consider how we glorify entertainers in a near toxic way. The way that the writing really has you trying to figure out what's real and what's not is so smart and clever. It adds so much to the film and show what Phillips has the potential to do. JOAQUIN PHOENIX: Yea, so this performance also deserves its own category. I'm not sure if it was Todd Phillips or Joaquin Phoenix that decided to give Arthur the condition, but that was a tier-1 decision. I can't imagine another actor being able to do what Phoenix did in this film. This performance is one that will be shown in acting classes for years to come. NEGATIVES: the biggest thing with this film is that it can drag. A lot of shots that the film sits on for a little too long. I understand it the build up to see the full 180 from Joker, but it didn't add much for me. Maybe this isn't a very credible observation, because this is one of those films that feels a bit long for me, but there not a single scene I'd take out. Similarly with Avengers: Endgame (although I liked Endgame much more). I felt this way after my first viewing and so I wanted to give it a second shot and I felt the same way on round 2. Even more so. CONCLUSION: This film is definitely a technically well made film with very good directing, editing, acting, cinematography, score, etc.. There a few memorable scenes in this film that people will re-watch over and over. I wish I could end it on that, but this film, although barely edging out 2 hours, I felt it went on a little long. I did like the transformation and not enough can be said about Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix on this one. 7.2/10."
481,"I do agree that Joaquin's performance was great, very well done and not an easy part to pull off. That however, was the only good part of the film. Movie was dark as I expected, but so much SLOW dialog it was putting me to sleep. Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story. I say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services, I'd ask for my money back but I did stay till the end."
482,"I am typically a fan of what Marvel has done, and initially saw no point to this movie when it was announced and couldn't see Phoenix doing the role justice, particularly after Heath Ledger's brilliant take on the Joker. How wrong was I? This movie starts slowly, and draws you into Arthur's world without you realising it until you can't look away from the screen for fear of missing a single second of it. It is raw, it is personal, it is disturbing, it is sad, and it is deeply resonant of some of the troubles we are experiencing today in the world. This is the Joker, arch-nemesis of Batman, yet you feel empathy for him, and can't completely disagree with his actions. He only hurts those who he perceives hurt him, even if his justice is fatal and doesn't befit the crime. ""Wrong me, and you are dead,"" is not justice, and each of his victims display their own weaknesses and frailties, and aren't inherently bad people. This is a brilliant movie. One of the few I went back to the cinema to watch again. It deserves Oscar recognition for Phoenix, Todd Phillips, cinematography, and the score. Congratulations all round!"
483,"First of all. It's such a well constructed world. Closer to reality than any other Gotham I've seen but just skewed enough to be different.

It's harsh and brutal but also lays society/humanity bare.

I'm not a Batman movie fan in general and I felt this was something different. Definitely worth a watch!"
484,"Todd Philips' ""Joker"" has spread so many comments and controversy that I don't know exactly where to stand. The film reminded critics of Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and while Joaquin Phoenix' performance channeled the inner angst and alienation that drove the driver Bickle to an extreme -and bloody- corner, I found so many other sources of inspiration that if anything, ""Joker"" is the best tribute to the New Hollywood period.

I found ""Network"" in the film, ""Death Wish"", references to ""The King of Comedy"", Marty's underrated movie about a man who wished to exist through the only talent he felt being endowed with... and naturally, there's something of ""A Clockwork Orange"" in the obscene stylishness the Joker embraces his new persona with. In a way, that the film met with controversy is logical, you can't make a social comment about violence and its dangerous appeal by sugarcoating it, violence like its enemies, use symbols and slogan, in fact, revolt is a mask that violence uses to operate undercover or is it the opposite? ""Joker"" is the slap today's audiences needed and that it used the Joker mask in our superhero era makes it even more relevant and accessible. But truth be said, any controversy the film should stir mustn't distract from the real deal.

Indeed, any viewer familiar with one tenth of Phoenix' filmography knows the actor's ability to portray enigmatic and troubled characters with a dark side barely hidden, but even with that in mind it's impossible not to be blown away by his performance and compelled by his suffering. He shouldn't be the dark horse of the awards season but the frontrunner because his performance is so rich, so powerful, so intense and so bizarre and grotesque in a captivating way that it's almost like watching a movie within a movie, as if his distortable face was the operation theatre to his acting force, as if his nervous smile slowly turning into cries made a true symphony of pathos and anger. That actor is a treasure to Hollywood and here he's given the kind of rangy performances that can't do without earning awards. His snubbing would be controversy material if you asked me.

Now, to the film. The first act immerses us in the life of Arthur Fleck, a clown and wannabe stand-up comedian. At first, I was afraid that the manic laughter scenes would be too redundant and turn themselves to cheap gimmicks, to remind us that we're dealing with the Joker, but no, Phoenix plays his Arthur as a man who's not a bad person. Raised by an over-protective and sickly mother, brutalized by kids who sees in a clown a living sign saying ""kick me"", humiliated by people who can't understand his medical condition, the point isn't to portray Joker as a martyr but a product of a specific environment and education, or lack thereof. Like anyone, he's got dreams, projects, but he's entrapped in a condition that makes it impossible to communicate or connect with the others except through hallucinations and would-happen moments, he's a misfit with a fragile condition that keeps worsening until it offers a platform for his dark psyche to perform.

Does the film excuse him? No. Does it justify his actions? Hell, no. It just clarifies the need to perform that way. There's a point of no return reached in that psychological journey, when one humiliation too many triggers a strong desire to express itself through a sort of showmanship, something relevant in our days where people seek any ways to reach posterity. Set in what seems to be the early 80s, it puts Arthur in the same urban alienation context than Travis Bickle but with a passion shared with Rupert Pumpkin's and a ""mad-as-hell"" prophetic rage with Howard Beale's role. Near the end, there's a shot that follows one of the film's most shocking moment and it's an obvious nod to the anticlimactic finale of Lumet's masterpiece.

But I can't insist too much on how good Phoenix his, one could see a few impersonations of Malcolm McDowell's dance when he ""punished"" his fellow droogs or get vibes from the two only performances that earned a posthumous Oscar, Peter Finch and Heath Ledger, still, there's something unique in that tormented role he inhabits with such a soul dedication that it makes Nicholon's Joker worse than the cartoon counterpart. ,

""Joker"" isn't dangerous but brave enough to question violence in the way it seems like the only plausible answer, it might titillate a few demagogue instincts but that's an unfair trial in the light of the recent events all over the world and that preceded the film. I walk often at night and see homeless people living in impoverished conditions, drowning their sorrows in alcohol and losing their manners once there's nothing to lose... and perhaps that's leaders' responsibility, praising democratic values while its application contradicts its own ideal. Anything is allowed when nothing is possible, is perhaps the biggest joke of all, and that it goes all downhill when the social budget is cut is perhaps the film's boldest stance against the shift between leaders and people.

And that it used Bruce's father Thomas Wayne to connect the final act with a canon we're all familiar with is one of the many narrative delights of that character study and psychological thriller à la ""Woman Under the Influence"" where suspense doesn't come from a bomb but a ticking bomb of a soul. If De Niro's presence ties the plot with its chief inspirations, the film belongs to Joaquin Phoenix who gave a performance for ages, and a character who's relevant in the way he pits democratic ideals against urban reality. And my wish is to see another connection with De Niro with Phoenix winning an Oscar, it would be the second time for a character who already won one after De Niro with ""The Godfather Part II"".

As for the glorifying violence trial... we've been there already."
485,This movie is absolutely amazing. Joaquin Phoenix did one of the greatest performances in the cinema's history.
486,"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8."
487,Philosphical approach and giving a viewer an insight how an innocent and troublesome mind can go mad. You feel the pain and anger in the justifications of actions performed in this masterpiece. Giving a morally complex and paradoxical taste of the jokers mind.
488,"A frustrated but relatively harmless guy gets pushed over a little too much and goes on a sick rampage. This is a story I've seen several times, the first one I remember being Falling Down, that 1993 movie with Michael Douglas. There were definitely some more, I just can't recall them, because the plot of such films always goes through the same steps, you just can't tell the stories apart.

I've heard so much praise for Joker, I expected something groundbreaking. Instead what we have here is one stellar individual performance in front of an otherwise dull and intentionally grisly landscape. An unsettled city full of unsolved social issues, cynical politicians saying things as if to fire up the situation on purpose. Violent kids on the street, white-collar jerks, everything around created specifically to depress the viewer.

Sometimes it does feel as if DC simply doesn't want its fans to have a single bright thought or a light emotion. It's a universe full of sad and uptight characters delivering to an army of equally sad people. At least before it was about one emotionally scarred individual putting on a mask and putting on a tour de force against the ""bad guys"". It was dark, but the action tried to make up for it. This time, however, there's almost no action - and you are just taken on a journey of the main character to join him in wallowing in all his personal darkness and drama.

Joaquin Phoenix is no doubt exceptional here, his performance is worth all the accolade it received. Besides that, though, Joker is simply too one-dimensional to be touching. When you paint everything black too many times, all the next layers of paint just don't make any difference, and even a clown's garish garb can't bring in enough color to make up for it. Joker is a beautifully messed up character, but he's nowhere close to Tonya Harding, another fantastic performance that was not given half the credit it deserves. Joker's craziness is predefined by his grotesquely gloomy surroundings, while Tonya's fate was a real life story of this very world. Makes one guess whether we can really sympathize with issues we classify as our own.

Despite a truly fiery (in all senses) ending, Joker the movie fails to ignite a spark of prolonged interest. If not for the crazy praise this film has received, one might not even feel pressed to share their thoughts on this film with others, turning the watch into a cinematographic one-night stand. Tomorrow, I will probably not be ashamed of what I did tonight. But is this experience simply forgettable without a hint of a lasting trace? Totally so. If people will be thinking about 2019, Baby Yoda is what they'll probably recall first, and that speaks volumes about this film's quality."
489,"Joker is a unique, raw and special movie. It is a violent story that shows us the slow descent into madness of our protagonist, Arthur. The movie was incredibly hyped to what runs the year, however, unlike what usually happens with many movies that cause such excitement, this achievement exceed any expectation. This is a movie that definitely deserves any possible ovation to her. An incredible job. It seems fantastic to me to know that the director was able to carry out a work of such quality that it will simply become a milestone in the years to come; it is a unique story, without censorship which shows us the development of a protagonist in such a fluid, effective and fascinating way that we can come to sympathize with such madness, a violent madness, raw and emotional. These words can describe the essence of this film, capable of transmitting ideas and sensations of extreme power and power that nothing can equal.

Much has been said about Joaquin's performance, and here I come to repeat the same thing, because he simply deserves it: It's incredible, it's perfect. This is the Joker that is capable of existing in this world, a performance as strong as human, a cruel and realistic touch gives enough support for us to understand the motivations of the character, who is not only a villain with a goal, or an idea, it is the explosion caused by the spark of madness. The acting is just sublime, and I'll say it at once; it's time for his Oscar.

Incredible, fantastically dark, every minute of this film is a work of pure passion, effort and attention to detail, you can more than notice the incredible work that has been put into it. Everything is simply fascinating, the direction, the incredible script, the beautiful cinematography, the masterful performance, the deep soundtrack, the emotional scenes, the fluid development, and so on.

Joker is a masterpiece. Psychological, powerful, crazy."
490,"Each generation becomes more imbecile.

In my boy's time, we enjoyed the superheroes and their masculinity.

Then the empotrated super-heroines appeared; Then the effeminate superheroes; And finally, they are enjoying the villains.

In the sequence, what will be the next imbecility?"
491,"Don't listen to the unbelievably high average score, this is not a great movie. It leans on cliches, it struggles to communicate vital character details, but it manages to pull together a strong closing act to elevate an otherwise inconsistent film.

'Joker' stumbles out of the gate by throwing a plethora of ""troubled loner"" cliches at us. The scenes read almost as a list, giving the early stages of the film a disjointed feel that hampers any sense of immersion. The only aspect of our lead, Arthur Fleck, that seems original is his affliction. His sudden outbursts of laughter during tense situations are used to great effect several times throughout the first act.

As the story continues, 'Joker' wastes time on a sub-par subplot involving Arthur's neighbor. Another sub-plot, involving Thomas Wayne, is far more interesting and clever in its execution.

Ultimately, 'Joker' becomes a story of Arthur breaking free and flourishing in the chaos of Gotham. The final act revels in his now unrestrained insanity. However, the film struggles to convey a clear image of what exactly is happening within Arthur. Is he an idiot savant, or a brilliant mastermind set free of his bonds. You can go back through the film if you wish and identify plot points to either effect if you wish (the latter seems more likely in retrospect). However, this failure of communication lessens the impact of the film, leaving you somewhat disappointed.

Nevertheless, the final act is an exciting close to the film, though it probably should have ended about 5 minutes earlier than it did (the final scene is unneeded). Regardless, the result is a unique and fascinating comic book movie held back from greatness by a shaky start and questionable communication."
493,Explains a lot and the story line moves at a good pace.
494,"We watched Joker tonight, and I expected good acting from Joaquin Phoenix, wasn't sure about the story and everything else but I was willing to see how it will go. What I didn't expect was that I wouldn't blink an eye throughout the movie. It was absolutely brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just give us good performance, but made Joker so real. Like he is one of us, and as my friend said - scary part was that you could relate to him and be on the same track with his thoughts. Everything is perfect in this movie - story, acting, photography, music... hell even the colors of this world are perfect. Joaquin Phoenix carried the whole storry on his back - it was an one man show that took all your attention, imagination, stirred all your feelings and emotions and left you speechless when The End letters came on the screen. The best movie this year for sure - Phoenix deserves Oscar for this one and any other reward he can get in this world. BRILLIANT!!!!"
495,"Nice movie, such a great performance from Joaquin deserve the Oscar with no doubt, Great cinematography, great music, the movie take comics cinema to another level."
496,"I am not a fan of the dd batman universe, I am never interested, but they recommended the movie and I do not regret those 122 minutes I spent watching this magnificent piece of art. The direction, photography and lighting is brutal and accompanies the progress and development of the plot and the character. Phoenix played the joker spectacularly and magnificently, I loved his performance and I found the best selection. The development of the joker and his thankfulness is incredible, his important moments were well managed and he loved everything about him. Frances conroy great as always. If you did not see it, watch it, even if you are not a fan or have not seen other movies, just watch it, because it is not essential. One of the best movies of the year"
497,Heath ledger would be so proud! It was amazing! Blew my mind ! I will watch it again and again ! After a long time finally a good movie ! Enjoyed every second with every cell of my body !
498,"The film is about tragedy and a work of art that should be taken seriously, no CGI cape crusader, no magic just pure emotions . It's like the rise of the Joker and the birth of the Bat. The laughter makes you cry and youre wating for that villain you love to hate but end up loving him more.... I wish there is more.. i wish to see this joker in the DCU."
499,"A well-made film by Todd Philips and Co. with a commanding and tragic performance by Joaquin Phoenix. The film gives us easy commentary on aspects of reality through the differences of social classes and the grasp on understanding mental illnesses. The main character, Joker, is the catalyst for the story and to tie it all together we get a very original take on the beginning of the comic-world's most notorious villain.

IMO, Joaquin's best performance will always be Freddie Quell in The Master, but this is very good. It appears he may be on his way to getting his first Oscar."
500,"Despite the memes, this movie is tense and unsettling all the way through. If you like dark comedy and a good thriller, this movie is for you."
501,"This is not sarcasm. Joker is a mainstream, wide-release movie which manages to not conform to cookie-cutter writing and directing, tries and often successfully conveys a meaningful message, and it definitely deserves some praise, 1 or 2 repeat viewings. And most of the jokes were hilarious.

Joker is a good character study, but it has a bunch of problems. One can see lots of reviews praising it as the best movie of the year/all time, that Phillips is a great director, and that Phoenix is just perfect. The story is a bit muddled. It could have done without the Wayne family's inclusion, with just their names and importance to the plot. The story is good, but it tries hard to be smart and hits you over the head with reveals instead of being subtle and clever with its setups.

However, Phoenix' performance elevates the movie. His and Frances Conroy's are great. He is always mesmerizing to watch in anything he is in, but this was very visceral. It's hard to empathize with his character most of the time, but we become aware of the political messages of the movie, which is pretty hard to miss and very spot on.

This movie is very similar to Taxi Driver, but not as well written. It's well directed and the actors do a good job. It is far from the best movie of the year, since Parasite came out in 2019 as well, but Phoenix performance is what most will remember. I hope all following DC movies will be a lot more ""real"" like Joker, with better writing and smaller budgets, no CGI, just character studies of crazy villains in a real world."
502,"Disturbing. Just got out of the movie. My humor was much better before seeing it. At first feel pity for the guy suffering, but he lacks charm and then well he is just a killer. Heath Ledger was far better."
503,"One of the best movies and acting. Movie was so good that i feel myself inside of it. People must watch it that haven't watch it yet. There are many people are like this character in real life. So, we should respect every single person in our really life, that's the lesson that this movie tough us. One of the best movies and acting. Movie was so good that i feel myself inside of it. People must watch it that haven't watch it yet. There are many people are like this character in real life. So, we should respect every single person in our really life, that's the lesson that this movie tough us. Thanks."
504,"He is an absolute legend in this film. He deserves all the praise in the world for this chilling performance. The movie itself is not only just a great comic book but a great movie in general. This is a movie that is going to change comic book films for the next 10 years. And I stand by that statement

Final rating: 9.2/10"
505,"This Movie Really Did gave me a surprise, its more than a spin off or a stand alone, its also a breathtaking exprienced. But i would not say this movie is rewatchable, despite its phenomenal performances the story is quite slow and some times you need patient watching this movie, so i will say this movie is a once in a lifetime expriences."
507,"Oh my, after walking out of the theater, this is hands down, The most memorable film I've ever seen in my life, I loved it, I thought it was excellent. I recommend any Marvel fans or DC fans to see it if you haven't"
508,"I've never seen a movie (with the possible exception of The Force Awakens and The Incredibles 2) to be as hyped as this with both good and bad things emanating from that. Ever since the first trailer came out in April, I've been waiting to see it. I knew that this wouldn't be like any other comic book movie I'd seen up to that point (I've yet to see Logan and Watchmen). And indeed, from the trailers it looked like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, both of which also star Robert De Niro. Even still, Joker perfectly encapsulates everything about the character. The Clown Prince of Crime, the Jester of Genocide, the Harlequin of Hate. The movie gives a believable and more than fitting backstory for the Joker. If not than you could look at it as the story of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) just an unfortunate and deluded man with aspirations of being a comedian who endured one too many kicks in the teeth. It is a comic book movie but more dark and gritty than any I've ever seen, including The Dark Knight. I often don't like the way that DC assumes that since the Dark Knight trilogy the only path to success is by way of the dark route, without actually taking the time to do it right. Joker does it right. And with an R rating it's not for kids."
509,"Look, I know I'm swimming against the tide, but I seriously remain extremely disappointed. I couldn't pick a score for the movie. But I mark aspects of the movie as follows; Entertainment factor: 0 stars. Relentless, deep, dark and disturbing theme: 0 stars. Single redeeming feature: well-played by the entire cast, but Joaquin Phoenix's superb acting surpassed excellence: 11 stars."
510,"Lets start with the obvious, any scores of 1 or 10 are to be ignored as they tend to be comic book nerd scores (1 means Marvel fan, 10 means DC fan).

This movie really has me mixed on what to think about it. I understand they wanted to make a movie about what makes someone turns into a villian, so they decided later having it be about Joker would make people actually want to see it. Which is why I give it such a low score. If you needed Joker in it in order to get people to see it, then maybe it wasn't a good movie then.

I love Joker (the character). I've loved every iteration of him. And I can see why they chose him because he does fit the part for what they wanted. And while they do state this Joker is its own alternate universe sort of Joker, it still feels off. It feels more like a movie about a unstable man, but with some Batman lore stuff hinted throughout just to make it more appealing.

Am I saying the movie is terrible? Not by any means. It was actually pretty good. If anything Phoenix did an amazing job making you care about Arthur yet also feeling creeped out by him. I should also note this movie is in NO way for kids.

If Joker was removed from it and it was just a movie about a man gone bad, I'd give it a 8 or 9 probably. But again, using Joker as the selling point since they said no one wanted to see it otherwise, really made me deduct points."
511,This movie is getting a lot of praise and this film deserves IMO its better than Endgame and The Dark Knight!!!
512,"Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there? Arthur Fleck

That definitely feels true. Joker is set in the early 80s and is loosely based on the origin of the Joker (DC Comic character and arch rival of Batman). This version is written and directed by Todd Phillips (the director of The Hangover films...yep) and stars Joaquin Phoenix in the title role.

Almost everyone has their opinion of the film and how they feel about it, so take what you can from them, but, this is what I thought of it.

The Joker is a gritty hard hitting study of a man's decline into madness. Arthur Fleck is a lonely troubled man, who between caring for his ill mother and performing for kids as a clown, dreams of being a stand up comedian - his only problem, he isn't very funny.

This sounds familiar and fans of Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese will recall King of Comedy (1982) and the painful Rupert Pupkin having the same dilemma (incidentally De Niro plays the chat show host Murray Franklin whom Arthur adores). Unfortunately Arthur or 'happy' as his mother calls him is living in a world that just doesn't understand him, again sound familiar? Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver (1976). Clearly these two films have influenced Phillips and he borrows seamlessly from them, but this is not in the same calibre as these, it stands alone.

The central performance from Joaquin Phoenix delivers the punchlines (sorry). His lean skeleton holds the meat of the film (sorry again). He is mesmerising, he portrays sadness, depression, anger, loneliness and happiness brilliantly. It's a masterclass on acting, he lives and breathes the character.

The supporting cast is good, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy to name, watch out for Glenn Fleshler (Remus from Boardwalk Empire) and Brian Tyree Henry (Paper Boi from Atlanta).

The music is standout, Icelandic Hildur Gudnadottir sets the right tone and style to the film (to be noted she did the music for this and Chernobyl at around the same time). There has been some subject of debate for one music choice and I don't why that particular piece of music was used when others could have been selected, perhaps Phillips was wanting the reaction? (jerk). The cinematography is good and adds grittiness to the screen, the makeup is good too, I like how Phoenix has adopted a different clown paint - slightly reminiscent of Doink the Clown from WWE though).

The film is rated R so be prepared to see violence, however there are probably less deaths in here than in most of the Marvel films, yep, and when it happens you can feel the magnitude of it.

I would still recommend seeing this (unless you have coulrophobia) and making your own mind up on how you feel about it, one thing is for certain you will be talking about it for some time, which is what Phillips probably wanted - 'send in the clowns...they are already here'."
513,"Ugghhh how could I be so wrong in my assessment of Joker when the majority of film goers and film reviewers have rated this abhorrent film an average of 8.6 on IMDB? What have I missed seeing? How can over 600 thousand film goers have liked this film and the film receive 11 Oscar nominations when both Mrs. Shullivan and I just hated it and considered it as much a waste of time as we did with the 1977 acclaimed film Eraserhead?

Joaquin Phoenix being nominated for a best actor Oscar? You have got to be kidding me? Maybe he should have been awarded a medal from Weight Watchers for shedding 52 pounds for his pathetic role as the brooding and mentally disturbed Arthur Fleck aka Joker. But an Oscar nomination?

We chose to next watch the 2019 film Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood which was nominated for ten (10) Oscars this year and it is competing with Joker's eleven (11) nominations. I will be shocked if Joker wins any Oscars and even more shocked and disappointed if Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood does not win against Joker in any of their competing categories.

Let's see if my rating of 3/10 holds true on Oscar night and if Joker gets shut out as I would anticipate it would."
514,Wow just totally mesmerizing played so well by Phoenix his character was truly believable and you see the joker evolve into The Joker. It gives me chills seeing who he actually was as a person it was breathtaking. Such a good movie to watch
515,"I had never heard of Joaquin Phoenix before this movie, but he really delivers a masterful performance. It does a great job of making you relate to the character and sympathize with why he goes off the deep end. It moves sort of slow, it's more of a psychological thriller than an action movie."
516,"I don't ever give 10/10 to films just because they are good. An 8 or 9.

To get a 10, it must be extraordinary.

Oh my and isn't Joker just incredible.

I took my 15 year old to watch this in the cinema and after around 10/15 minutes we had to walk out because the atmosphere this film generates, from the start, is quite unsettling. My child simply couldn't take the slow build up of menace, even after 10 minutes. So I happily took us out of that showing and into a showing of Brad Pitt's Ad Astra (snore fest btw).

So when this appeared on streaming services, I decided to watch it on my own. Cinematic history has always been in my life since I was a child (of the 70s).

To take 70s America, to utilise one of it's most revered films (Taxi Driver), seamlessly weave that in with another classic (The King of Comedy), to get Robert DeNiro to be in it (who starred in both of the aforementioned films), to re-invent the origin story so much that it still sits well with the original origin, to include beautiful cinematography, utilise an incredibly relevant soundtrack, dramatise that with tense music, deal with the themes of mental illness, neglect, societies role (more so to make it pertinent to today's world) and have that originally scripted and directed under the guidance of a man who gave us The Hangover.....just wow.

Todd Philips really has put his directing credentials to the fore.

And what of Joaquin Phoenix? My word he has bettered the role of Joker. Heath Ledger's was amazing but this has so much more. This performance was heartfelt and menacing.

I honestly think this is one of the best films I have seen in 2020.

It leaves so much for you to make of what you will and still keeps things realistic and moving to an ending that allows one to accept that this is the end of the film and that also leaves open the possibility of more.

I really hope ""The Batman"" film references back to this film because DC are back in the game. This is what they are about. Excellent story telling."
517,"The people have hoisted this movie high onto a pedestal - and those that haven't have grabbed their pitchforks. This film has arrived during a bewildering time in our country and the world at large, a time when shootings feel more prevalent than ever and months-long protests in Hong Kong have gained international recognition. Given the context, and the importance of the pivotal movement occurring in the new Joker movie's Gotham, some have claimed the film promotes not just protest, but violent protest. I think that's blasphemy. Sometimes, a movie is just a movie. Controversy has been a staple of some dynamic proportion of new films since the dawn of moving pictures, and that doesn't always mean the message is supposed to invoke violence from the masses. Keeping this in mind - and thus watching Todd Phillip's ""Joker"" as entertainment and not an invitation to anarchy - I can say honestly that it was an absolute blast.

Nobody is surprised that Joaquin Phoenix was up for taking on the role. He's a phenomenal actor with an impressive range; just watch him play Freddie Quell in 2012's ""The Master"" and then Theodore in 2013's ""Her"" and try to deny his scope of talent. What is surprising is just how enrapturing and satisfying his performance as Arthur Fleck turned out to be. Whatever misgivings you may have about the eruption of violence that occurs around his version of the Joker, Phoenix absolutely elevates this movie, and is impossible (almost to a fault, but not quite) to look away from him. He plays a broken man with a damaged past, and is so completely engrossing, so stunningly bleak, that it makes the film worth watching, and then watching again. Without spoiling anything, I can assure you that his arc is a triumph to behold, and I was clinging to every devilish smile, shocking moment, and chilling laugh that flashed across the screen. He's not trying to kick off an uprising for political gain; he just wants to share his bafflement of society's awfulness with the rest of the world.

Okay, so the performance was master-class, but was the film a masterpiece? Not in my opinion; the theme of rising discontent with the rich and/or powerful is an old one, and it's beaten with a ham fist at times here. But damn if it isn't difficult to admit that given how gripping and show-stopping the titular character turned out to be. And though he's the best part of the movie by a long-shot, he's not the only great thing that ""Joker"" has going for it. The film is interwoven with a harrowing score written by the same composer that worked on ""Arrival"", ""Sicario"" and ""Chernobyl"", and the music manages to pierce the air at all the right moments, heightening the intensity where it is appropriate and pinning suspense for as long as we can stand it. I have no complaints about the rest of the cast because they are all great (and would you guess this is Robert De Niro's highest grossing opening ever?). The movie is indeed dark, at times nihilistic and very often just bleak, but Phoenix screams ""NUTS to that"" and revels in the blackness as his tragedy-turned-comedy character transforms into a cackling murderer.

The critics have complaints: That Joaquin Phoenix was trying too hard, and that the themes were overt and annoyingly crass. I'd like to point out that acting your heart out isn't always trying too hard, and trying too hard doesn't always make you a great actor anyways. While his performance certainly does not feel effortless, I never once rolled my eyes - I was captivated. As for the heavy-handed ""message"", I say please - this is still a comic book movie. I'm not sure what you expected.

8.5/10 for the best performance of 2019 in a Cedar Point thrill of a film."

519,"What happens when the guy who made The Hangover series decides to cast an Oscar-nominated actor to play one of the most iconic comic-book villains of all-time? You just might not have expected something as dark and zany as 'Joker' to be the outcome. Here's an R-rated (supposedly) supervillain origin movie that screams DCEU but holds its own when it comes to storytelling and character development.

Joker is led by an explosive performance from its leading man Joaquin Phoenix. While no comparisons need be made to the versions of the character brought to life by Ledger or Nicholson, Phoenix, without a doubt, has clearly taken the character to even greater (and more notorious) heights. The first hour of Joker is an intense slow-burn. Arthur Fleck is a struggling clown-for-rent-turned-aspiring-standup-comedian who is often rag-dolled around by twerps (for being physically weak) and despised by (rich) commoners for his unusual demeanour characterized by unwarranted stretches of laughter.

The screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver takes its own sweet time to showcase Arthur's gradual breakdown and eventual embracement of anarchy. The only bits of comforting normalcy are (apparently) offered by his mother, his next-door neighbor, and a talk-show host on TV. However, there's more to each of these characters than what meets the eye. The disturbing themes and elements in Joker indeed require a separate study of their own. That being said, the reasons attributed to Arthur crumbling under societal pressures are well-fleshed out and coupled with a haunting score by Hildur Guðnadóttir, ravishing cinematography by Lawrence Sher, and the vintage Scorcese-like sets, the psychotic transformation (into Joker) is cent per cent believable.

Phoenix owns every scene that he's in, demanding your attention right from the opening scene where he pulls his mouth apart to form a fake smile. If the sole purpose of this character study, as the actor remarked in one of his interviews, was to shed light on (in addition to lending some credibility to) the uneasy life of Joker before he turned into the vicious version that Nolan gifted us a decade and a half ago, the film is a pertinent win. It is Gotham city (before Batman) indeed, and what's Gotham without the Wayne family? The Waynes' presence in the film will also surprise you in more ways than one.

What stood out to me were two (brilliantly written & directed) scenes: the first taking place in a moving subway where Arthur encounters three 'rich pricks' that sets the ball rolling for his 'transformation' and the second, during the climax stretch when all hell breaks loose in Gotham and a broken-down Arthur goes about his unruly antics amid a riotous mob. I felt the film did not require the 'extended climax' either, because the scene right before subtly told the viewer that the transformation was complete.

But when you look at the version of Gotham that Nolan built up versus the one Phillips does, one feels that the cynicism and hostility of its residents have been intentionally amped up for greater cinematic effect. Barely anyone in Phillips' Gotham (except for a handful) seemed cheery or comforting. Probably, that's what the makers were going for. Ignore the indistinct political commentary and you have a disturbingly dark piece of cinema in your hands! No heroes-in-capes are coming to your rescue here!"
520,"The Stream: Takes unbelievably long to get moving and then supremely predictable.

The Big Screen: Joaquin delivers an uneven performance but worth watching.

The Final Bill: Joker is an overhyped film that will create some conversations about mental health issues in society.

-S2S: Movie Review

Knock, knock. Who's there? Stream to Big Screen. Stream to Big Screen, who? Stream to Big Screen the best site for movie reviews on the internet! Corny? I think not. Welcome back everyone! This week we were able to view the highly anticipated movie, Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix. Joker is a standalone origin film of many people's favorite DC Comics villain. The movie is set in the worst of times in Gotham where violence is rampant, civil unrest is prevalent, and the rodent population is no joke. This movie follows Phoenix as the main character, Arthur Fleck. Arthur is a young man longing to fit in and aspiring to be a comedian but is dealing with a bevvy of issues, primarily mental illness. The film leads us through Arthur's path to becoming the titular Joker.

While this movie is titled Joker, the theme/takeaway from this movie is no joke. Ultimately, this movie hits way too close to home for American society presently. The bullied, belittled, forgotten person in society deals with mental illness without an appropriate support system, and he has access to a gun. This storyline has become an all too familiar in mainstream media today. For this reason, Joker is a very good conversation piece. But didn't we come to see a movie based on a comic book? This isn't what I wanted! Well, this is important to know. DON'T go into this movie expecting a comic book like story or a connection to the comics, other than the name.

With that said, Warner Bros. couldn't have found a better or more experienced lead actor than Phoenix. Phoenix definitely has practice acting like a power seeking maniac begging to be remembered. I'm looking at you Commodus! From the beginning to the end, Phoenix takes us through every single range of emotion Arthur experiences. It truly is quite impressive. Phoenix's acting and the movie provide a great feeling of anxiety, not necessarily suspense, throughout. Unfortunately, the director either held Phoenix back or chose to feature too many early movie boring set up scenes. When Phoenix acts his craziest, the movie is epic but there is just far too little of it to get over the boring parts. In a way, I felt deceived by the intense commercials and trailers. We've been waiting for nearly a year to see this movie. Yes, the movie provides a few intense moments but far too few. And, far too little of Zazie Beetz! Honestly, they could've interchanged her with any actress to do the same thing. Nevertheless, her presence was still welcomed.

And then when I wasn't bored, I was predicting exactly what was supposed to be a surprise or twist in the movie. I'm not sure if it was the scene selection or a purposeful directorial decision, but at times the same scenes just didn't make sense when I was watching them. Eventually, my suspicions were confirmed and I just said ,""duh!""

All of that said, Joker delivers in some aspects (I didn't even mention the great score in the movie) but ultimately will let you down. Joaquin does a good job as the Joker, but he's never going to be regarded like a Heath Ledger once the dust settles. Try to check this movie out at a matinee time, if your a big Joker/DC fan. Everyone else, you may be disappointed in a matinee price but for a reasonable price it's worth it or an early streaming rental"
521,"Joker is an original movie about the iconic Batman villain of the same name, exploring his origins. It tells the story of Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix), a man who feels rejected by society.

Joker is a mind-blowing film. Director Todd Phillips has given us a one of a kind comic book movie, that delves deep into the psyche of its titular character. What we get is a riveting film with twists & turns, that will leave you guessing, right till the end. Joaquin Phoenix is the star of the show, as Arthur Fleck. Phoenix completely immerses himself in the role & gives us another unforgettable performance. He deserves all the praise, accolades & Oscar buzz coming his way. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker, matches up to Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker, in The Dark Knight(2008). He also gives us a perfectly chilling 'Joker laugh'. Robert De Niro is awesome as Murray Franklin. Zazie Beetz is spectacular as Sophie Dumond. Frances Conroy is outstanding as Penny Fleck. Brett Cullen is amazing as Thomas Wayne. Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Glenn Fleshler & Leigh Gill are superb as Detective Burke, Detective Garrity, Randall & Gary, respectively. The supporting cast is excellent. Joker is a must watch for all the fans of one of the best comic book villains of all time. Go for it, as soon as possible!"
522,"Joaquin Phoenix was SUPERB as a mentally disturbed person that had been emotionally and physically abused as a child. After having grown into an adult, the mental illness increased and deepened. Joaquin deserved to win BEST actor in the Academy Awards. With that being said, this movie was one of the most disturbing and twisted movies I've seen. The script must have been written by someone who was deeply full of despondency, sadness and despair. Disturbing movie. Excellent acting."
524,"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic. It touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this: JOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER. Go see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well."
525,I loved it and it was amazing. The movie was about an isolated comedian and his problems. I think it could impact in so many people because now everyone feels lonely
526,The beginning seems slow and dismal but it's supposed to. It's showing you how the joker was created and the monolgue it builds up to is worth the wait. I genuinely cried.
527,"I'm was not Phoenix fan until this movie. Truly one of the best, well acted, and visceral movies of the year. It's haunting, it makes you feel, and it makes you sympathize.... and you'll be thinking about the quotes and messages for days. It's true to the Joker... and even the negative critic reviews acknowledge that the movie makes you ""feel"". Awesome job all the way around. Loved the ending."
528,"Not only is the Joker the best comic book adaptation on film I have ever seen, it is by far the best film of 2019 I've seen. The moments that gave me chills were the scene when Arthur is holding little Bruce's face and then when he is in the stairwell with his mother's medical chart and verifies everything Tom Wayne told me was true about his mother. Learning everything he thought he knew was a lie and the anger that grew within him that bought him to such disillusionment with his world it made him kill the one person he most loved in his world and turn him into the psychopathic killer. Her death killed Arthur Fleck and reincarnated him into the Joker. The twist with Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz ) was brilliant and totally unexpected.

Wow. This film was like a Greek Tragedy play. This is the film I wish all other comic book movies were modeled after. Nothing is over the top, everything is plausible in this realistic world. No super powers or grandiose schemes. Arthur Fleck is just a regular man like the Waynes, but without the fortunes of the Waynes. Just a man who beleaguered with abuse, lies, manipulation and misfortune that snaps into the killer he becomes.

I did not want the movie to end because I loved it so much. My bladder was at the point of bursting but I did not want to leave my seat and miss a thing. This is a titanium scribed A++. It is rare I think of any movie as a perfect 10 out of 10, but this movie hit that score. I was left thinking about this film hours after I left the theater. DC Black finally blew away everything Marvel had out of the water with this film. All thanks to a super talented film director and one of the best actors of our era Joaquin Phoenix. If the Oscars don't see it fit to grant him an award, then the Oscars have no redeeming value."
529,"Joker is a devastating film and is in no way a comedy. This film is as dark as it gets, and yet every time I watch it, whether when it was in theaters three years ago or at home with other people today, I always seem to be the only one not laughing, and that is sad to me. The laughter just shows how little audiences get this film and shows how much audiences need to learn more about mental health. This is a film about a man struggling with his mental health and he is knocked down time and time again, and when he snaps everyone laughs, but the reality is that it is incredibly tragic and sad and not many people recognize that. If people could watch this film as something other than a comedy they can find a deeper meaning and appreciate it more, because it is a very well done film and Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely tremendous."
530,"I liked Joker. JP was great fun to watch, and the atmosphere is great. It establishes a tone and sticks to it all the way through. It builds tension and has good payoffs. It's the kind of movie that I could walk into at any point and be drawn in to want to finish viewing. I hope they go through with a sequel. Normally, I wouldn't say that, but this movie just begs for it."
531,"Its the best movie.

It is good.

Everyone loved it

I did and my dad did too."
533,"This movie is everything that's wrong with Hollywood. Indulgent, pretentious, overly long and very very dull. The luvvies, the shallow and the right on brigade will love it. No doubt Oscar winning stuff.....lets get the virtue signalling started now"
534,"I can understand why some people would not like it. The pace was slow. There were moments that would make the audience saying ""What?"", kinds of like playing games. However, the movie on the whole was a powerful one. We were basically in his head most of the movie. We saw what he sees, and this guy was a walking time bomb. He had many sign of trouble, lack of confidence, self insecure, and loneliness. Because the problem was not treated, he went spiraled down. He could be a metaphor for many brewing problems, like he could be Hong Kong since the Tiananmen Square massacre when the city got traumatized for those who know the history of the city. Despite the slow pace, I thought it fitted perfectly his inner struggle and his mental breakdown. The setting was outstanding, and needless to say the performance. Hard to say if I still like it on another viewing, but at this moment it is one of the best movies I have seen from 2019."
535,"According to one ""WOKE"" blogger an ""intellectually ludicrous and philosophically empty"" film. That would make Joker laugh ... they just don't get it do they... Joaquin has taken on the impossible task of breathing life back into Joker after Heaths legendary occupation of that ""unsafe space"". And just like Lazarus, Joker rises from the dead. Joaquin is the only actor who could ever have pulled this off. It is an outstanding performance. In the old days, when the Oscars actually rewarded talent, this would have been a sure bet for best actor. Now the Oscars are ""WOKE"", not a chance. Joaquins physical transformation for this role stunned me. Not as shocking as Christian Bales for The Machinist, but impressive. In an attempt to get the public NOT to see this film, the ""WOKE"" have spread disinformation that mass shooters dressed as Joker are targeting film screenings. And Joker laughs again."
536,"Real life,real stuggle,real sadness.Every person can compare to him.Masterpiece!"
537,"Joker re-invents the perspective we have on who the bad guy really is.

The most of this movie is based around Arthur Fleck before he takes on Joker, and shows a descent into the evil madness he has in all past Batman films.

The film is certainly not for the faint hearted, it leaves you constantly on edge, and when his impulses happen, you sit there in shock-horror.

Violence wise, this movie is obscene. Psychologically, this film is terrifying to watch in how crazy Joaquin Phoenix really depicts Joker to be, so it's difficult, besides the acting performance to really pinpoint why this movie is enjoyable.

I feel like Phase Four Marvel has been trying to give a social commentary vibe to a lot of what they do, so they should really do what DC has done: don't mellow out how horrifying things are. You need a strong cast, but also to not leave out the nitty-gritty if you want a successful film.

Joker by no doubt sealed itself as the best DC film since the Dark Knight Trilogy, and I'd go as far to say that I preferred it.

In conclusion, watch it. I don't like to spoil things on reviews, but this film is exceptional, and you should definitely go into it expecting violence. That tension meant I comfortably watched it all in one sitting, on my phone on Amazon Prime (yes, it's on prime)"
538,This is the kind of movie you only see once per decade or so and realize that you are watching a future classic/masterpiece of art. J.Phoenix is hypnotizing to watch and deserves two Oscar statuettes if that was possible for his performance as Arthur/Joker. Also Todd Phillips deserves an Oscar for both the directing and the writing of this movie. A true masterpiece and a must watch. Speechless for any other word to describe this movie. 10/10!
539,"He was absolutely brilliant in this role, every bit as good as Heath Ledger. I'm rarely astonished by an actor, but he nailed it. I had never thought of him as a very good actor, he was awful in 8MM with Nicholas Cage, clearly he has been honing his craft all these years, and it's a joy to watch him in this film as he ratchets up the crazy with each successive scene. Deniro's intensity is long gone, however, it's a little embarrassing to watch him read lines he probably read over breakfast before heading to the set with everyone fawning over him and telling him how great he is. Yawn. The rest of the film works, as a socio-political commentary about class differences and interesting observations on nature vs. Nurture.

Joker isn't perfect, however, there is the disappointing abundance of loud stringed music to help you sympathize with the character, totally unnecessary because Phoenix is able to do that without the sappy music. And the premise of the clown agency is odd...why not just go out and hire yourself out as a clown, you don't need an agency to do that."
540,What lifts this movie to the next level is easily the performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Say what you will about the script (basic but decent) and plot clichés but it's the acting that takes it to a movie that would've been okay into something good and moving. Joaquin won the Oscar and BAFTA for this performance and it was well deserved.
541,"I didn't want to like this movie. I thought that a Joker movie without Batman in it just wouldn't work and that it was a dumb idea. I have never been more wrong. The Joker was a very well made movie with great drama and a great story. The thing that really gets me are the messages of the movie. The story is about a guy who was beaten by society and treated like garbage until one day he snaps and shakes the system. I love how the Joker's jokes are something that nobody else can get because they don't understand. When I first seen the movie I would've given it a score of 7 or 8, but the movie really grown on me, so I have to give it a 10."
542,"Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again

This was a journey into the land of insanity I really enjoyed Joker's stroll into the realm of psychosis.

Sanity is such a delicate, tentative, state of being, the Joker would know. The problem with insanity is how incredibly sane it feels."
543,"I tried watching this twice & I couldn't get more than 30 minutes in. It was the most uncomfortable awkward thing I've watched in a long time, couldn't sit through it."
545,"Joker is not only the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life or the best movie of the 2010s, it's the greatest comic book movie. No comic film before or after will ever come close to this level of greatness. Everything about this movie from the gripping emotional story to the tone to the music the acting and cinematography is just amazing. The best part is no CGI and it proved you don't need it to tell a good story

Joaquin Phoenix plays the best live action Joker we have ever seen. Throughout the movie we see his character, Arthur Fleck, constantly abused, mocked, bullied and picked on by society just because he's different. That he has a condition and is viewed as an outcast. By day he works as a party clown, while also taking care of his ill mother. It gets to the point where Arthur reached his breaking point and slowly transforms into the Clown Prince of Crime as we know

This movie also did a brilliant job with adding so much realism and how society treats not just people like Arthur but anyone in general. There's a lot of nasty people out there that will take advantage and leave you high an dry when they have no more use for you

A true masterpiece and a work of art"
546,"Joker is a spectacular take on the iconic character. The acting is phenomenal, where Phoenix shines and the supporting cast works well as a contrast to his mentally ill mind. The plot is enthralling, developing at a pace that naturally continues to surprise. Emotionally, the film produces a strong capacity for provoking intense scenes, assisted by the strong editing and sound. There are a few plot holes and questionable moments, but these largely prove negligible. Overall, Joker is exactly the iteration that was needed for such an unpredictable character."
547,"I have long been a fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but this film blew me away. I was overwhelmed by his presence and absolute ownership of the role. I didn't expect a lot from this film. I knew that Phoenix had won the Oscar, but I did not expect such an overwhelming performance. One of the best films I have seen in years."
548,"Joaquin Phoenix plays the role of Joker absolutely amazingly! The music, casting, storyline was perfect and very much enjoyed it. There was even an applause at the end when I watched it at the cinema."
549,"Wow, amazing acting from Phoenix as usual. Taxi Driver and Seven vibes, with noir NYC atmosphere. Great musical score and an important commentary on mental illness and child neglect."
550,"People on the internet is the main marketing stream to this movie. Memes and quotes from this movie have taken over, driving other people to fall into the hype. Well, it's average. The only good thing about it is Phoenix, and when the actor solely grants a movie a 6 star review means that he was pretty amazing but the movie itself is really average. I'm not saying it's a waste of time, but just watch it away from the hype and you might actually enjoy it"
551,It is very depressing so need a mood to watch it but it completely blown me away. It was just perfect. The acting is excellent and how they cut and made some parts slow movement was just perfect! It totally makes sense how joker became who he was in batman.
552,"Technically there's nothing wrong with this movie. Phoenix's acting deserves all the praise, beautiful photography, etc.

From beginning to end, the movie is crowded with cinematic old clichés and rather cheap tear jerkers showing the downfall into madness of a very unfortunate man, which ultimately seems like a starved up pale attempt to pair itself as a film to brilliant pieces like The Shining, Taxi Driver or Cruise.

This movie really doesn't show any version I've known of The Joker, none. Since creator's Jerry Robinson's 1951 version up to Alan Moore's work for DC Comics in 1988, The Joker character developed in a certain direction that could have been amazing to explore in a more artistic way than previous DC films, instead this movie looks like the last assignment of an art student did before graduating, with enough money to hire DeNiro and Phoenix, but that's far from being such a breakthrough art film."
553,"Somehow the darkest and most serious movies get the highest ratings. People say that this movie is so thrilling and that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar but at the end of the day, it wasn't entertainment. There were so many evil moments and dark scenes but what's so good about that?

This movie was almost like instructions on how to be a psycho. They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!

The point of a movie is to entertain audiences and this movie just made me feel depressed and miserable. I'll have to watch a movie where the hero is clear and the villain is clear so I can actually be entertained. The fundemental and successful formula for a film."
554,"I haven't felt thrown under the bus in the best way possible as a viewer and cinema lover since 2008 after watching 'The Dark Knight'. This is a haunting, eerie, tragic masterpiece that deals with themes so contemporary but in a hard and complex way. Not every artistic team can achieve a home run this Epic. Todd Phillips has made his best movie and Joaquin Phoenix has managed to outdo himself with a human, multilayered, unforgettable performance. Impressive."
555,"""Joker"" is a thrilling film. That makes the audience feel uncomfortable from the very beginning. The first scene where Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) looks at the mirror sitting in front of his desk creates on purpose a moment of silence tension and first impression over the character of the joker. There are two main problems with ""Joker"": first it is an origins story, we've seen millions of movies that tell an origins story of a superhero so in this case it is not revolutionizing. Second, the movie is two hours in which we see a person with psychotic problems and how his life is miserable. So we get it, Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor and he could have won the award for best actor with no problem. I would have given Phoenix the oscar without even watching the film. The movie doesn't have to be two hours. The moments I enjoyed mostly were the last 40 minutes of the film in which Joker is at the top, he has changed and finally became the iconic character he is. Other moments I enjoyed throughout the film were the perfect moments of tension between characters, how Arthur Fleck's interactions with his surroundings cause tension and escalate. The soundtrack composed by Hildur Gudnadottir is perfect and ties well with the tone of creepiness the movie has. Though I'm not sure this movie came to my expectations. I've heard the enormous amount of excitement towards the movie and how everyone thought it will win ""best picture"". But once I saw it I couldn't understand it's success. Sure it is a new take on the joker's character but it isn't a movie that would be remembered as a revolution or on the same level as ""The Dark Knight"". It is of course a really good movie but I would tell you to lower your expectations."
556,"In a year full of mediocre films and some mediocre comic book films, Joker is a HUGE breath of fresh air. Joker is a fantastic film and a fantastic comic book film. Although the film is great, there are a small handful of issues. Unfortunately, most of those issues are spoiler related so I can't talk about them. The one I can talk about is that the film does sometimes borrow a little too much from the films it is inspired by, Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1983). If you have seen either of those films and watch Joker then you will know what I am talking about. Other than that and my spoiler related issues, the film is almost perfect. Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job as the Joker. You can barely recognize that it is him because he just disappears into this role. The way Joaquin Phoenix shows this slow downfall of his character is incredible. Robert De Niro also does a fantastic job with his limited role. He's cold, calculating, and manipulative and it's perfect. The sequence of events that the film portrays is perfect. It doesn't quickly get to the ""Joker"" but spends most of the film showing the slow downfall of his character. The film does this to perfection. This film is incredibly dark. There are multiple moments in the film that your jaw just drops at what happens. The film uses violence to its advantage. The scenes where it is used in adds to the already huge amount of tension that has been built up which leads me to my next point, Joker is incredibly tense. There are multiple moments where events are slowly building up and you are just on the edge of your seat waiting for the climax of that scene and when it happens, it feels super satisfying. The score for this film is amazing also. Hildur Guðnadóttir has so many outstanding compositions that adds to the tension and gives us an insight into Arthur's mind. The cinematography is surprisingly really good. It always provides a way to show us how Arthur is feeling while also getting other necessary shots. Joker is a film that has to be experienced on its own. Ignore the controversy behind it and try not to pay too much attention to the critic reviews. You have to see the film and depending on how you feel the film portrays issues like violence and mental illness will determine if you like it or not. Overall, Joker is exactly what comic book films needed with a breathtaking performance from Joaquin Phoenix and an interesting, dark, and realistic approach into an iconic character. I give Joker a 9.5/10."
557,I watched this movie last night. This movie is simply a masterpiece. I usually can pick out faults in movies. But not with this one. Acting was excellent! Cinematography was excellent! Writing was EXCELLENT! I was captured from the beginning and couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
558,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
559,"Now this is why i keep going forward in life because of films like this masterpiece with a true message and by far Phoenixe's best role, some great acting and him and ledger are good in their own way.

Definitely a well made jokers origins story, i couldn't ask for it better, everything about it, the cast, picture, action and the plot were fantastic and definitely sets up Christopher Nolans magnificent Batman franchises."
560,"Following in the footsteps of Catwoman (2004) and Batman Begins (2005), Joker tells the origins story of one of the key figures from the Batman canon. We are introduced to Arthur Fleck (played by Joaquin Phoenix), a mentally ill man who has a very peculiar condition: in moments of extreme stress or discomfort he will break out into paroxysms of uncontrollable laughter. His disturbed psychological state and unnerving physical condition lead him to having problems finding employment or any sense of acceptance within mainstream society. Nevertheless, he harbours dreams of becoming a comedian.

However, the barriers to Arthur's success stem from both his inner struggles and the fact that Gotham City more generally seems to be reaching a point of crisis. Budget cuts mean that rubbish is piling up on the streets, and the threat of robbery and violence appears to be around every corner. In response, Thomas Wayne (played by Brett Cullen), a local billionaire, has anointed himself as the city's saviour and plans to run for the position as Gotham City's mayor. But the last thing the city apparently needs is an out-of-touch billionaire maintaining a colossal gap between the rich and the poor. Another hero is demanded, or, better yet, an anti-hero: someone who will burn down the entire structure in the hope that something better might emerge.

One of a very small number of films to take place within the Batman universe without featuring Batman himself, Joker more than makes up for the lack of the Dark Knight. This is because the film is an intense character study which is powered along by a sinister and hypnotic performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix's Joker is a man in pain. He suffers due to his mental illness but his suffering is compounded by the way in which he is abused and abandoned by society. Thus, we are presented with a surprisingly sympathetic portrayal of Batman's most famous adversary. Each step into murder and violence that Arthur takes is at least in some way a reaction to the misery, ridicule and violence that is inflicted upon him. He is a man who is beaten and broken by his surroundings to the point where he has nothing to lose and his decision to turn his ire against society, as opposed to against himself, is depicted with a cathartic heroism. The authentic misery and suffering Phoenix portrays through the character, complete with his skeletal figure, maniacally twisted features and dark, pain-filled stare, serve to intensify the heroism of his blood-soaked acts. This makes the film deeply subversive.

As well as heroifying violence and murder, the film overtly acts as a black mirror reflecting the political situation of our era. In today's world, the gap between the rich and the poor seems to be forever growing larger and many feel as if traditional political figures are no longer effective in these more challenging times. Those on the lowest incomes or in greatest need are increasingly feeling abandoned and ignored. Against this backdrop, the film acts as a stark warning to all those in society who have been able to prosper while so many have been plunged into destitution: a reckoning will arrive and ""You will get what you deserve.""

As a stark, disturbing character study the film functions extremely effectively. Phoenix is the film's centre but he is diligently framed in early scenes in wide-angled shots walking through empty streets and inside empty buildings, thereby heightening the protagonist's sense of isolation. Of course, the film notoriously borrows many of its techniques in this regard from Taxi Driver: another film about mental illness, societal disconnection and social isolation. However, although the film lacks originality in terms of its style and theme, it certainly does not in regards to its central performance.

The art direction is eye-catching while also being austere. Muted colours are used throughout helping to create the film's gritty, off-key mood. Joker is often filmed dancing in slow motion in a physical expression of both his triumph and pain. Darkness also appears at key times, particularly during the main subway scene, which heightens the nightmarish quality the film possesses.

The way in which the film includes elements of Batman lore while telling its protagonist's story is also a marvel to behold. Tom Wayne is a compelling, albeit minor, character. And we even get a scene with a very young Bruce Wayne. The dovetailing of the film's climax with an infamous aspect of Bruce Wayne's backstory is particularly skilfully achieved.

The above, then, detail the ways in which the film succeeds. There are, however, a number of issues with the movie. Going back to the concern with originality, it does often feel as if director Todd Phillips borrows a little too heavily from his idol Martin Scorcese. The Taxi Driver parallels are palpable but so is the profoundly obvious inspiration of The King of Comedy. All modern directors stand on the shoulders of giants but the line between homage and plagiarism feels as if it's being crossed on a number of occasions.

The extremely heavy reliance on Phoenix's performance does also mean that the film has pacing issues. The physicality of Phoenix's portrayal is fascinating but there are at least one too many scenes of his primal cavorting. A sub-plot regarding Fleck and a possible girlfriend is also ineffective and highly predictable and should have been abandoned before the final cut.

But the biggest problem with the film is the way in which it communicates its overall ""message"". It is presented to the viewer with the subtlety of a rocket-propelled mallet smashing into one's skull. The film is so obviously a canvass for justified debauchery that it blunts the political points that it seemingly wishes to make. There is value to not making your intentions so obvious. Phoenix has the ability to show so much, whereas the script, time and time again, resorts to megaphone-operated bellowing.

Overall, this is an at times mesmeric experience which will disturb, repulse and revolt in equal measure. It also provides an uncomfortably realistic glimpse into the mind of an ill and abused individual. On top of this, the film is a miraculous effort in that it demonstrates that such levels of character depth and overall stillness can belong to the comic-book universe. But the lack of restraint in key moments and the failure to build on the inspiration of iconic films, as opposed to simply borrowing from them, means that this film falls short of achieving genuine greatness."
561,"I watched this for about a week ago on blu-ray. In hindsight I must say that I thought the film to be really good. I didn´t wanna rate it directly afterwards but rather let the experience sink in.

I´m not an expert on the world of DC comics, although I read a lot of the comics growing up (in Sweden). In Sweden the Batman character was (in the seventies) named ""Läderlappen"" (The Leather Coat) but the Joker was Joker(n). The most interesting stories for me was when Batman encountered the Joker. A complete madman, nutcase and homicidal maniac! I give two thumbs up to Todd Phillips, Scott Silver and Bradley Cooper for taking this daring step. Credits due when and where credits due. Kudos also to Warner for giving the film the green light. I know it doesn´t follow DC: s origin of the character but this is not that film. This is a parallel universe to that universe. This is more rooted in reality. With a twist, this could actually happen in real life. Come to think of it; just look at all the nutcases that has been and are very much alive now. Serial killers, sadists and paedophiles.

This film also have one of cinemas most fascinating character developments ever. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely fantastic! What a marvelous performance. In my opinion, it´s up to par with that of the late Heath Ledger. Before becoming the Joker; he is Arthur Fleck (gotta love that surname) who is a very(!) troubled soul already. From the first scene it is obvious that he is going down the abyss. Very sad and heart breaking. The supporting cast is very good. Especially Robert De Niro. I also thought they handled the Wayne family arc and the tragic event that awaits them very good. Just looking at young Bruce Wayne in the alley after you-know-what brought tears to my eyes...

The music is very fitting. Eerie, dreadful with glimpses of beauty. Production design is top notch. The colours are vibrant and stunning. The direction by Todd Phillips is excellent. None of that spasmic teenie weenie mobile cell phone swiping cutcutcut. The camera takes its time, moving slowly..panning, following the character rather than directing it. Of course there are scenes with faster editing when the scene deems it fitting but not all the time.

This film comes highly recommended by yours truly. A must see."
562,"I haven't watched yet Taxi Driver or King of Comedy so I won't make any comparisons between those films to this one. I will say, though, that this film is quite solid in its own right, imo.

Joker tells the story of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who lives in poverty, striving to get recognition from society without success. As you probably know, the film is an interpetation of the comic book villain by the same name, Joker, though as far as I know the backstory thing kinda goes against the premise of Joker's character in the comics. So, once again, I'm gonna look at this movie as a standalone piece for now.

On a technical level, I find Joker to be pretty decent. The soundtrack (the score too, but especially the soundtrack) is really *on point* here, and it adds a lot to the film. Great picks there. The cinematography is descent overall too, though it doesn't do much extra (and there are some shots that I don't really like here and there, but not much). It's well made, but don't expect something with tons of personality.

In terms of emotional investment, I'd say that I had a problem connecting with Arthur on my first watch, but in rewatch his struggle seemed much more clear and...well, human. Relatable. Even the actions he took that were odd to me character-wise on first watch turned out to make much more sense on the second one. I think that the process he goes through in this film is generally well-built throughout the film. I think that this is what makes the plot of the film work so well - there's a very well made build-up that leads to an awesome climax.

I do take issue with the dialogue, though. It's fine most of the time, but I just think that it seems too mechanical here and there, and it doesn't have a good flow. Also, I do feel like this film could dive much deeper into the political aspect of it. Yeah, I know, this film is mostly about a character and not about politics, but I can't help but feel like Joker could've been better if Phillips would've used the political aspect in a more clever way.

So, overall I find Joker to be a pretty good film. Its well-built, well made, the plot works well overall, and though it is flawed and I don't find it as deep or moving as some people do, I do like it. I'm feeling a 7.2/10 on this one."
563,The acting is good but they waste the movie time with repeating the same subject there is a missing part in movie to give attention to the storyline Just watched him laughing only and the repeated it many times for nothing Actually i did not complete the last 10 minutes as it was boring and each time tried to leave i was saying just give it another 10 minutes maybe something will happen but really nothing
564,"Nothing short of what I expected. Hands down the best psychological drama ever made, as best as I recall seeing. I never thought that The Joker could be the hero, that would pretty much make everyone else the villains, but it does happen! He does it! Monumental performance by Joaquin Phoenix.

Honestly I thought the script would be brilliant, but it's just about good enough, he makes it seem brilliant! Or maybe JP just embodies perfectly the vision of the screenplay writer, and they're both equally good! I've seen it in something akin HDrip and enjoyed every moment of this movie and I await the Blu Ray release so I can enjoy it again, in more detail!

The only way you wouldn't like this movie is if you'd be too much of a child or too stupid for it, as it has the most substance a movie can have, by a fu*king continental drift from the lot! It may be my favorite movie ever, but I have to see it a few more times to be certain! I give it good chances though, I liked him before, but this is the 1st time I truly loved a Joker!"
565,"Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stunning performance as Arthur Fleck, AKA Joker, in this jaw-dropping masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come. It proves to be more than just a comic book villains backstory. 'Joker' meticulously captures the gradual decline of one man's mental health, and shines light on the subject of mental health in general. There are points where you begin to sympathize with the madman. Despite some of the terrible acts he happily commits, you find yourself rooting for him which leads you to question your own morality. The world has viciously beaten this man down, and this is only the beginning of his retaliation.

This is, without a doubt, Phoenix's best performance so far. He carries the entire movie flawlessly, and leaves you with a lot to talk about afterwards. The brilliant method actor ensures that people will feel this characters pain, and does not disappoint for one second. Robert De Diro, another brilliant method actor, gives a fine performance as Aurthor Fleck's favorite comedy talk show host, Murray Franklin. Though he's only in the movie for roughly 10-15 minutes total, he does a very well job at depicting a phony, belligerent, television personality. Brett Cullen also gives a fine performance as the billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, and has a part in Jokers madness.

The word 'masterpiece' should never be thrown around lightly. It's a term we use to describe an outstanding, almost perfect, piece of art. There are only so many films that can be considered 'masterpieces'. Rarely do we ever see a flawless movie, especially this day in age. With that being said, it is hard to NOT consider 'Joker' a masterpiece. Every scene is just as important as the next, every actor delivers a wonderful performance, and Todd Phillips does an outstanding job directing the villains transformation. 'Joker' absolutely deserves a 10/10, and nothing short of that. This movie holds a mirror up to society; it should make you question what part society takes in one's slow drift into madness. This is very relevant to today, and is a perfect example of why something like this needs to be addressed and taken seriously. Everyone needs to see this movie. Again, it will be talked about for many years to come, and could very well be considered one of the greatest drama/thrillers of all time."
566,"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both."
567,"Unnerving from the start, this is a masterpiece which tells the story of one man's descent into madness. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is a tour de force, by turns both sympathetic and horrific. Film of the year and deserving of an Oscar"
568,I can't explain actually that how perfect this film is.
569,"Modern America is like Murray show where opinions are created for greater masses & every difference is looked upon with contempt. Such is mindless campaign to boycott a movie because it will provoke violence in a country where gun can be bought while shopping for groceries.

Joker is examination of people's behavior towards those in need, sick individuals who are pushed to the margins just because they need help. While city is choking in garbage, funds are being cut on social help & medical care, elite in suits are smiling while watching Chaplin. Wayne is not different then the others and he's finally given human approach rather then all good hero that tried to save Gotham in all other creations.

There are no heroes in this movie, there is no light at the end of tunnel & there is no sympathy for titular character but rather a big punch in the face from Todd Phillips to all of us who are actually living in our own Murray show day in day out without ever taking time to reflect what surrounds us.

Joker is a must see movie that will make you think about times we live in, about our role in the system & the ones on top never liked ordinary thinking people. Burton took his Joker straight from comics as he fell in acid, but Phillips only needed to put his protagonist in today's world.

So who's laughing now?"
570,"I feel the odd one out here but the pacing seemed very off, the acting was great. By the time the film got to an interesting point I was already wishing for it to end. Could have cut a good portion of this film out to make it much better and much better in pacing. Far from a cinematic masterpiece which it should have been."
571,"Not, in my view, the masterpiece it is claimed to be, but certainly enjoyable and highly watchable comic book film that extends that genre into Scorsese psychopath territory. References to Taxi Driver and King of Comedy appear to be an attempt to deepen the character of the Joker here. These references also have the reverse effect, however of making you miss the relative subtlety of the the films being referenced. That said, the lead performance is enjoyable to watch, and so self-confident in its masochistic wallowing it is not surprising that young men in particular relate to this film and see a lot of profundity in its pessimistic view of a man's place in modern urban living. The anti-hero's inability to fit in, get a job and a girl, make him all too likely a hero for young, out of work guys struggling to be males today. Good performances in secondary roles and background detail, gritty photography and interesting use of music add to the overall texture and enjoyment. So great entertainment, great as a comic book film, but too black and white in its world view of rich and poor, or too self-contained in the central character's head, minus the necessary irony/tragedy, to make this truly great."
572,"The film had it moments, Phoenix did a good job and I noticed few homages to Heath ledger. It isn't a spectacular movie but it isn't forgettable either. It will linger in your mind for the rest of the day. People should be kind to each other."
573,"I'm keeping it short, the movie sucks.

Yes, I know there's a need to build character and crap, and I think it's important for any good movie.

Same goes with this, I get it Joker was a troubled man, I get his frustration, but I don't need 2 hours of the movie telling me the same crap over and over again.

Give the guy an Oscar for performance but throw this movie into the trash right after."
574,"Todd Lewis really hit it on the head, with the inner message of this film. Amazing!"
576,"This movie is a masterpiece. Best movie I've seen my whole life. Joaquin Phoenix is just beyond amazing, the best acting I've ever seen from any actor ever! Must see."
577,"As we know about the Joker's character, he's crazy and smart, but in this movie we saw a different Joker. We watched Arthur's life before he became the Joker. This movie excels in several things, Including directed and produced by 'Todd Phillips' 9/10, cinematography it was so amazing 9/10, the great acting by 'Joequin Phoenix' 9/10, the classic music was so wonderful with atmosphere of the movie 8/10, From the beginning until the ending the escalation of events was perfect 9/10. I'm glad to everyone who worked for this masterpiece 8.5."
578,"When I saw the magnificent Heath ledger a few years a go in his excellent role as a joker I doubted that any one can make such an amazing performance as Heath did . Years after Heath tragic death 💔 that break our hearts Joaquin Phoenix bring the tears into our eyes again for this masterpiece , I can't really find the words to describe how Phoenix was great , the cinematography is absolutely amazing the music is outstanding, I know that Phoenix is a great actor especially in his beautiful role in HER but actually in his new role as ajoker I think he put a new standard out there and I doubt that it will be some years before any one could reach it"
579,"They show us how he Living with Desperate world. Social issues with people. Can't Protect himself Against the society. Can't control his emotions. Eats lot of Medications. Suffers from a sick condition. Becoming the Joker: starts changing his attitude, , Attending stand up comedies, writing jokes for his comedies. Liar friends, can't stand the problems with the society its self ,they Beating him up, After that he sick of the how the society treat him and then his attitude change with the worse."
581,"There's no real need to explain how excellent Joaquin Phoenix's acting was. I also really liked the cinematography and the use of that specific yellow color throughout the movie. However, this was far from being the origin story of a one-of-a-kind mastermind psychopath criminal. The events that led up to him losing faith in society and should have turned him into Joker were kind of weak. There were other examples of this same exact plot without the superhero universe elements; ""Falling Down (1993)"" or a more recent and cringy version of that ""God Bless America (2011)"" had main characters that were pushed to their limit that eventually turned them into violent serial killers. But Joker is not a mere serial killer. And for me that's where the movie failed to portray his real mental state which made him the actual Joker that we came to know.

Origin story of Arthur Fleck aka Joker."
582,"Really incredible film, while the film itself has some issues, Joaquin Phoenix gives a memorable performance as the Joker and just as Heath Ledger made the Joker his own, so has Mr Phoenix."
583,"I saw this movie on opening weekend in (accidentally) the same theater that the 2012 Aurora ""Batman Shooting"" occurred.

I only realized where I was when I asked my friend about the ridiculous amount of police presence all over the theater grounds.

I'm not really sure how that information played into my initial viewing experience, but I came out of that tension-filled environment generally thinking that Joker was a slightly overhyped, but ultimately successful take on the character.

I watched it again last night on HBO MAX and quickly realized that the film had soured on me quite a bit in the last couple of years.

Joker is a decent character piece with a stellar performance that, while a showcase for Phoenix, does little to advance narrative, plot, or worldbuilding.

Instead, we get a lazy homage to Scorcese thinly veiled as a Joker movie.

The writing for this movie is bad. Dialogues go nowhere and say nothing. Interesting lore is hinted upon then quickly abandoned. It's pretending to be brooding and thoughtful with nothing to say.

The plot is just ""Watch Phoenix the Clown go crazy for two hours while he kind of does King of Comedy or whatever.""

Thankfully, Phoenix finds a way to make the titular character both electrifying and terrifying. Joker's demise is like a fever dream, and Todd Phillips has no problem just turning down the lights and keeping the camera and the film centered on Phoenix's bonkers delivery.

It works for the most part. As long as you had this performance, you could replace ""Joker"" with any damaged soul and it would still accomplish all the same things.

It's an award-worthy portrayal of a broken man with very few options, and it's worth checking out for its central display.

Everything else is subpar.

Its Batman elements are ham-fisted into its overly-simplified plot, and there's no solid theme or even the bones of a formulated philosophy. It's a puddle-deep, needlessly-constrictive movie that at least understands that it has nothing really going for it but its lead actor upon which it can rely, so it does just that.

Phillips is able to save this movie from disaster by letting his star just kind do his thing. It's ballsy, and it's admittedly enthralling to witness, yet in retrospect it's a missed opportunity to really do something unique with this setting and this lore. Or even at least deliver any cool themes or thought-provocation.

Slightly disappointing for me, but it's still worth a watch.

7/10."
584,"I'm making sure to give this movie 1 star because it's definitely not a 8.9 - that's a lie.

Joker is not an amazing movie. It's far from great. More to the boring side.

It lacks plot twist and focus too much on character development. How many times someone needs to get punched in the face before they go crazy?

He suffers, gets fired, has a mental illness, nobody loves him, he's sad and he cries and he laughs and he laughs again. And he kills some people, and that's it, that's the movie."
585,"""A gritty character study of Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded by society"" is IMDB's excellent byline description of this deep exploration of disintegrating (disintegrated?) mental health.

It's described as taking place in the 'Scorseseverse' by some critics, in that Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck appears to be an homage to many of Scorsese's monumental 70's characters. And what's more, De Niro has a supporting role that shows he still can deliver the goods when not just taking a part for the money.

So I've already used the M word and in this Academy Award winning performance (of that there is no doubt) Joaquim Phoenix's monumental performance will put the Academy back on track after their laughable decision to recognise Rami Malek for impersonating Freddie Mercury last year.

I detest impersonation movies on the whole, but this is no impersonation, this is a character crafted out of magic. It's not a superhero movie in the slightest and all the better for it. It's simply a character study of great depth and extreme nuance.

One thing I loved about this intense study of a disintegrating man is the extreme close ups that shows Phoenix in all his imperfections, his upper lip, his wonky teeth, his chewed finger nails, his nicotine stained fingers (possibly make-up). It's glorious.

It is unquestionably a masterpiece, not just for Phoenix's performance, but for every SINGLE aspect of cinema: music (White Room by Cream blasts out of the screen in the final apocalyptic act to tremendous effect - but it's outstanding throughout), make-up (stunning), costume (stunning), cinematography (stunning - the dance on the steps and the aerial train track shot particularly blew me away), design (epic) and direction (Todd Phillips follows up his epic production, but not direction, of A Star Is Born remarkably It's interesting looking at Todd Phillips' Filmography though - a real mixed bag with much of it centred on comedy - The Hangover in particular.)

But you don't need me to tell you how good this movie is - you don't get a 9.1 rating on IMDB without reason.

See it and bathe in its mastery."
586,"To put it plainly, this feels like a masterpiece but it isn't really yet still it moves like one. To have a movie about a character in a comic book world portray a message so important in the real world and almost necessary makes this somewhat A- yet masterfully directed and acted movie a masterpiece. 10 out of 10 for me and I will dare again and call it a masterpiece. Its view may scar you but more so it will make you wonder how much possible it is."
587,"This movie is related to every single person on this planet. Because at some point of our lives, we at least once ever felt alone, lonely, unwanted, neglected. Maybe not as extreme and painful as Joker experience. Joaquin successfully brought up the atmosphere and vibes and feeling that Joker felt, he delivered it well so we could get it, relate to it. The cinematography is awesome, with the lighting and shooting angle, we're brought in there. The music has the right vibes and placement throughout the movie.

Joker is that type of movie that you need to watch, a true masterpiece that u can't miss."
588,"It's definitely The movie of Phoenix! Perfect acting! He needs to get Oscar! I found though the movie so depressing. I mean it's Joker, you do not expect s peaceful, full of joy moments but that was quite overwhelmingly depressing."
589,"Joker. Where do I even begin. Never expected a comic book movie to talk about such serious issues that we as a human race face today. Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated. And the best part about Joker is that it never takes a stance to position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur guðnadóttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is an surreal, out of body experience. Watching some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance. And these are just my thoughts on the film. Go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say."
590,This sure is a masterpiece. It is directed and acted so beautifully that you just can't believe someone really has given performance like that of Heath. The Dark story for which DC is famous for is really wonderful. When it's about JOKER no marvel can match it for sure (Not a DC or MARVEL fan still have to agree about last line).
591,"I have no idea what to think of the movie. For two hours of ""entertainment"", walk away. For two of an artistic character study of a very troubled person that should be troubled, go for it. OK, you did the poorly treated creepy clown thing. Also you wonder the message of the crowd. Is the a righteous movement or a force to be stopped at all costs.

After I thought of it as an anti-hero character study, go get ""Cool Hand Luke"" or some other great anti-hero movie. You will be entertained and conflicted about the hero with either range of emotions and see great cinema and not wonder what you just watched for two hours."
592,Plot: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Acting: 10/10 Pacing: 10/10 Music: 10/10.
593,"I love how I now have an understanding of the Joker's back story.

Throughout the movie we are shown how he's had one of the most messed up my life's possible and how he became the Joker.

Only reason I've given 7 not 8 is because I felt there wasn't so much of a ""story"" there in addition to his life's struggle. We don't see a relationship really."
594,"This film is undeserving of the praise it received. Boring and uninteresting in every imaginable way. A failed celebration of derangement culminating in the end with an act of cowardice. There was no depth, only subcutaneous attempts at shock. It was predictable and boring."
595,"I just got out of watching Joker

I have to say, it is really good... Possibly even great!! As a stand alone origin story, it's damn good. It moves at the pace of a 70's movie, so it may not be for everyone, but I found it mesmerizing to a level that it makes it an absolute winner. I think if they chopped about 15 minutes off the run time, it would have been better, whilst not missing a beat. There are elements of The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver as well as American Psycho.

Now... Joaquin Phoenix might as well clear a space on his mantelpiece for an Oscar. I would be shocked if there is a better performance this year. The man is in every single scene. He carries this and at times, you forget that he is acting. His laugh is so real and twisted... The way he lost weight and transformed his body... The pain his character suffers and all the discoveries he makes that shape his life are just amazing and gracefully danced into a spectacular performance.

There were a few predictable moments, but nothing to spoil the enjoyment!!

Overall, this is a film to see, just to see one of the greatest actors of our time at the very top of his game.

My screening was packed!! Only a spare seat here and there (annoyingly an ex and her new fella were in attendance🙈) second only to Avengers: End Game was was a complete sell out."
596,"Joaquin Phoenix put's on a masterpiece performance, his portrayal of a decent into madness is breathtaking, you feel sympathy for him despite his crime's, the best film I have seen all year."
597,"First of all, I'm not good with Comics and anything Marvel/DC related. I don't know any stories, or any facts whatsoever. I went to watch Joker as a standalone movie, like any other movie; and it was great.

It is a slow paced movie. Methodical; you pretty much get to sympathize with Arthur Fleck; you get his pain and his delusions. Joaquin's performance is top notch!

I liked this portrait of the Joker. A delusional maniac, hysterical, insane. When you see the Joker's' development into a satyrical killer, his descent into madness, it's fantastic.

Overall, good movie! Not sure if it breaks any paradigm over what's in the books/comics, but, as a standalone movie, it is good."
598,"Joker (2019) is ambitious, tragic, meritorious, a dark comedy, exhilarating, and a masterpiece in cinematic storytelling. Director Todd Phillips, after several questions over his ability to direct a praiseworthy Joker film, delivers a classic movie that will be forever enshrined in the memories of those fortunate enough to experience it. Phillips deconstructs the superhero genre and turns it on its head, forming a film that feels and IS an artful indie film rather than a prototypical A to B superhero movie. Every scene in the film has purpose for Phillips. There is a love for the story being told and a direct care in the manner it is portrayed. And for this Phillips should be praised. He navigates the complexities around the character of the Joker, introducing a fresh take while also attempting to pay homage to movies such as Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Yet, the movie never falters, not even for a second. It moves through each scene not just feeling new, but breathtaking beautiful that will have you applauding before the credits even roll.

Likewise, the details in this film are remarkable, as Phillips not only has one listen to the film, but we actively live in it. We can feel the nasty, garbage-filled streets of Gotham often represented through careful and strategic use of symbolism. But of course, while the movie itself is remarkable, it needs an anchor - the great Joaquin Phoenix.

Phoenix delivers the most jaw-dropping performance in a film of the 2000s, and perhaps one of the greatest and most memorable performances of all-time. While the character already complex, Phoenix dives so much into the role that you can hardly recognise him. He is at times funny, delicate, innocent, sometimes he is tragic, heartbreaking, and at times he is the dangerous, horrifying, and unpredictable. Through his complex play on the ranging emotions of one Arthur Fleck, Phoenix becomes the epitome of the Joker.

So is this the best comic book movie of all time? For most moviegoers that will be the question. And this film transcends the genre in a manner that has not been done since 2008. Likewise, while the Joker movie is more of a tragedy or even comedy than it is a superhero movie (imagine an indie film with DC characters), with the inclusion of superheros, or supervillains in this case, it will always be a superhero movie.

So where does it stand amongst other CBMs? It is top 2, battling with another film that featured the Joker, The Dark Knight."
599,"Classes between rich and poor will collide. The poor will take from the rich. This movie is reality of such. Well done, acting super, cinematography super, score super. Violence in comparison to other violent movies was not at a maximum yet graphic yes. If you can't handle it watch The Lion King."
600,Good look into the psychological development of the joker.. not a movie for those looking for an action packed film.
602,"You probably going to see this movie with high expectations, because you already heard some good reviews. You will not be disappointed. This film is extraordinary and stands out of all the other popular movies this year. While seeing and enjoying it, I had an inner conflict whether I should rate it an 8 or a 9. After leaving the theater i stuck with an 8.5, but to this point, I did not realize what kind of masterpiece I have just witnessed. The days after watching the film i looked up some articles and videos about Joker and started to understand why I could not stop thinking about it. The whole movie can be interpreted differently, depending on how you read some certain scenes. If I had known that Martin Scorsese influenced Todd Phillips about this piece of art, I would have viewed it differently from the beginning. Of course Phillips landed some blockbusters with Hangover, but he can also direct a serious movie, which really builds empathy with the characters. Despite the excellent possibilities of interpretation of the Joker, the music amazed me. Together with the acting and cinematography, it built an absolute fantastic atmosphere and made it much more intense. There are brutal scenes in this film, but they absolutely do not support violence, but support the character and seriousness of the movie. I totally recommend seeing the Joker to all of you!"
603,"Not a single Comicbook movie excited me until this one and that's because of Joaquin and Joaquin only. This character is tailor made for someone like him who has given terrific and criminally underrated performances over the years in films like The Master, Walk The Line, Two Lovers and Inherent Vice. Todd Philips made the right decision to a character study psychological film rather than the usual adventure/action.

Gotham City is like NYC in 1970s/80s a city with massive wealth inequality, rising crime and brutal austerity measures. In surroundings like this, a fragile and broken individual like Arthur Fleck is bound to explode but how he does and why he does is what we see for 121 minutes. The undertones on anarchy, capitalism and classism is quite brilliant and this is one of the films where we cheer for the guy we are supposed to dislike.

Joaquin Phoenix not only does justice to Heath Ledger in this film but creates an own legacy for himself. It's a shame that a guy who has given better performances in movies like The Master and Walk The Line will probably win his much awaited Oscar for this role, a highly popular character to get noticed."
604,"This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea.

Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.

Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.

With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.

The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.

The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.

With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers."
605,"Led by Joaquin Phoenix's ferocious and swashbuckling performance, this dark movie explores the Origins of the most famous character of the Batman series after Batman himself. ""Joker"" is a movie that's drawn more toward real-world troubles than to capes and crusading. The dark essence of the movie is very well spread out in such a way that it makes it difficult for the viewer to understand weather joker is an protagonist or an antagonist of the movie.

With Joker, director Todd Phillips sets aside his penchant for juvenile comedies like The Hangover and channels to explore the dark side of humanity and the origins of joker. The film rages at the human condition and the darkness that might break a person and turn that person into a monster. Specifically, the director points fingers at the wealthy and powerful, who claim to want to help but make it impossible for the downtrodden to pick themselves up.

Phenomenal screenplay adds tremendous value to the acting capabilities of Joaquin Phoenix as the joker who embodies the utter despair of this situation, digging deep with a full-bodied performance, forever struggling to find hope but faltering at every attempt he makes. Skeletal and dark-spirited, he moves his limbs like a spider, either twining as if spinning a web or flailing and flapping like a manic cartoon character. But Batman's famous nemesis isn't just villainous any longer; he's a heartbreaking mistake that could have been prevented. It's no coincidence that Joker is set during a garbage strike, given that humans here are thrown to the curb just as easily as black plastic bags.

In this very bleak movie, the bright colors of the Joker's clown makeup offer a violent, horrifying escape. It helps that excellent cinematography adds an extended dimension to the storytelling. Editing, make up and production design for the 80s feel is just outstanding. Music explores and almost teases us to dance to the mind of the joker. Robert de Niro's acting in a supporting role, though remnants of his 1982 black comedy ""King of comedy"" is simply outstanding.

Joker in my opinion is the best movie of 2019 and will be remembered for a long, long time singlehandedly for Joaquin Phoenix's performance. A must watch movie for Batman fans or people who like to see something different."
607,"Everyone knew this movie was going to be great at least. Joaquin Phoenix is one of the greatest actors at the moment, it has a good director, which had total creative control of the movie, and was inspired by the best storyline of the Joker. It is a mega realistic take on this villain, it actually makes you feel a lot for him and empathize with a lot of the situations he goes through. Arthur is the best thing in the story, and while the backstory of the things happening in Gotham arent as interesting or well built, it is still done in a good way. My only problem is that at some point you can get tired of the depression and bad things that happen in the movie; they are perfectly fine and they make you feel more for arthut, but the movie is kinda long enough for you to start wishing that the end is near, it is a little tiring at some point. Still, a great movie overall of the Joker origin."
608,"Joker review 10/10

-They way they built this movie to the point of his ""final"" breakdown was amazing -Every time he gets ""hope"" it gets demolished and it increases every time -They way they tied real world problems -The cinematography and visuals are amazing -They way they tied in the Wayne's -Oscar worthy performances by Joaquin Phoenix"
609,I....I just can't believe..This movie is beyond good. It's same quality as Christopher Nolan movies. I love the every second of them. Every person needs to watch this movie.
610,"There is no flaw in this film. From start to finish it is exceptional. Ths soundtrack is perfect. The darkest comedy I've ever seen and the mix of the two is balanced perfectly. When the final credits ended, I was left completely satisfied and knew what I had just watched was a masterpiece and easily one of the best films, if not the best film I've ever seen. I will be watching this film over and over again for the rest of my life."
612,"Phoenix deserves all the glory that he is receiving for this role. Philip's is restraint and proves he is quite talented outside his usual comedy films. Joker is insane and utterly unpredictable. As a modern day comic book film, it has paid off. A darker DCEU was promised by Snyder, but BVS was a mess of idea's. Joker is interesting and thought provoking, something the MCU can only dream about. The Black Panther is not the Joker by any means, so expect to see this sitting at the Oscars. Ambitious and a film with longevity. Will Ratch Catcher be introduced in the future films? This could be a way of DC and WB separating from the core Marvel comparison. Lower budget, adult focused films. Time will tell."
613,"You will be silent while watching the complete film. It gives you a new experience but not a good experience. The actor rocked with his outstanding performance. If you think it one way it's a great film but if you think the other way the movie has nothing. Finally, I would a say it's a completely different movie."
614,"Actually, the hype was sooooooo big that I was sure it will blow my mind. But it was mehhh. Really, truly mehhh. I swear God it was just mehhh. What is wrong with you people? It doesn't even come closer to Ledger's masterpiece. Is everybody blind or something? If I had drank every single time he faked that irritating laugh, I would have ended up in the hospital of alcohol poisoning what the...... man ????"
615,"Review: 'Joker' is an American psychological-thriller film directed by Todd Phillips. Being one of my most anticipated movies of the year as well as a movie I never wanted to be made, I was feeling so many different emotions on my way to the theatre to see this film. I needed time to think about it and process what I had just seen because the movie is very dark and heavy, and after doing so I believe this is my favorite film to come out of 2019. The movie follows the character of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who is working as a clown-for-hire while living with and caring for his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City. We see Arthur get beaten down by society both literally and figuratively, from being jumped in an alley to being fired from his job and being called crazy and useless. Slowly over time, he starts thinking his life is a comedy and transforms into the clown he has been portraying for years. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal in this movie I will be both surprised and disappointed. What he did to prepare for this role was incredible and he brought everything to every scene he was in. Everybody in this movie fit their roles perfectly, but other than Joaquin Phoenix another standout performance for me has to be Robert De Niro. He wasn't in the film a whole lot, but I really believed he could have been a Talk-Show Host. He didn't phone it in at all and really committed which I appreciated. I really can't talk about what I liked in this movie without going into spoiler territory. However, I will say that the movie needed to be Rated-R and I'm so happy Todd Phillips pushed the Studio into letting that happen. There were certain scenes that I could tell if they tried to do the same thing in a PG-13 film, it wouldn't have worked. They were also very smart in showing Arthur slowly progress into the Joker we know and it didn't just all happen at once, he hated his life in the beginning and dragged his feet when he walked, and by the end he is carrying himself with confidence. Overall, I really can't say a lot about this movie beside I loved it! I beg for everybody to go and see this movie in theatres, movies like this deserve to make money so original films like this can be made. Yes, even though this is based off a 'Batman' character, it is still a very original story and I highly recommend. 5/5"
616,"This movie does everything right when it comes to telling a story via film. The cinematography, score, acting, editing, and storyline are all excellent! The main reason I am not giving it a higher rating is because I found it hard to enjoy. To be fair, the movie is not intended to be a joyful experience. It feels uncomfortable on purpose. For me, personally, that keeps me from wanting to watch it again. For others, that might make it a 10/10 movie."
617,Joaquin Phoenix carried this film completely. There are no supporting actors. He is a special talent. It's not the run of the mill movie.
618,"I avoided this film for some time due to an aversion to violence (thinking more about needless comic book violence) but today, with a storm blowing hard outside, I watched it. Not at all what I expected and certainly not always easy to look at (and not due to the scenery or lighting which were both very skilled). Others may describe the excellent technicalities of the film but I'd like to add a more sociological aspect. We, society, never learn do we? It goes round and round; in this case class warfare, deliberately ignorant government, mockery of those who suffer and the self-righteousness of the elite. Well Joker shows us the consequences and as history holds it is always a form of revolution, in this case violence and mayhem in the streets of Gotham. How reflective of today's world. Not to be watched for light entertainment, this is a serious movie."
619,"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.

I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.

Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.

The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.

I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before."
620,"Regardless of whether you like it or hate it, I think the film explores how the Joker is the way he is because he can't be otherwise, literally. One of the greatest dangers to America itself is American culture. It's not terrorism that will destroy America; it's American culture that will ultimately be the undoing of America. The film looks to examine our distorted points of view or detachments from reality and show us that WE, as a society, have the same characteristics of the Joker. The Joker is a product of this materialistic culture we live under. Epistemically western culture is motivated by striving for money, status and recognition, which is focused on results and efficiency but that can have severe consequences because you're always judging yourself with the person next to you.

The movie Joker is what you get when you take American culture, and you take it to its pinnacle. When you exaggerate it to the extreme, you get someone like the Joker. But the critical hidden message is that we need to become more aware of our OWN double standards within ourselves. We need to start to empathize that we have the same mechanisms as the Joker has. So, on the one hand, I can criticize the Joker, but on the other side, I can also see why he acts the way he does, but more importantly see it collectively. Notice that trying to rid the world of evil only creates more evil. Everything you might criticize; corporate greed, different beliefs, religion, people you dislike, violence, war, mass shootings, even just hating this movie - We like to criticize things, but while we're criticizing, we're NOT really thinking about how we ourselves are part of the very same problem that is contributing to the cycle."
621,"The film itself is not remarkable . having said that i am not a super hero movies fan in fact the only one i saw was the dark knight because of obviously Heath Ledger , but this movie was a bit slow based to a point that bores you and again Joaquin comes and grebes you with his amazing acting skills and the way he shifts his face and his voice is just so mesmerizing . although i think he had a huge responsibility taking the role after the late one but he was fantastic in it that i allowed my self not the compare the two . i said to my brother when we were getting out of the cinema that the first made you despise the joker and the later made you feel for him and amazingly justify what he did"
622,"From the first shot onwards, you're drawn into the world of Arthur Fleck. The slow descent into the madness, the history in his family, the world thats constantly pushing you and finally, when he snaps, the feeling of liberation. The music is a fantastic accompaniment to the mood of the film as Arthur from being pushed against the world, breaks free and takes control of his life, albeit in a manner thats totally destructive. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. Up against the obvious comparison to the benchmarks set by Heath Ledger, Jaoquin holds his own and sets the stage for the origins story. Obviously, the two story arcs don't exactly match but the narrative is close and the mood is soberly set. There aren't the typical Marvel/ DC movie large action sets and mayhem taking place with the camera moving all over the place. The movie is set closer to the characters, showcasing the flaws, cracks and choices one makes - either by design or by forced by circumstances larger than yourself. This year, no other actor has done something this remarkable and clearly, this is the year of recognition for Joaquin. It is a joke that is having the last laugh."
623,"De Niro did it first but I ain't mad! Amazing film, great acting but I felt like I was looking more into the soul of Phoenix not the character- either way I didn't mind."
625,"Bored during movie, very slow Dark knight was far better than this Acting is very good Direction is very poor"
627,"Joanquin's best ever performance. And this is a brilliant, empathetic movie."
628,"This is legitimately the best movie that I've seen in a while. It goes through you and shifts your mind, view of the world and perspectives 180 degrees. Yes, it may be painful for some to watch, but ain't that painful for those who can relate with the feelings and emotions experienced by the character. I feel that is just gonna make some big waves for a while and then it will remain kinda forever in our memory and on our retina. Phoenix, you are a little God!!"
629,"I am not a fan of Batman movies (though I have watched them all) and I really hated the Dark Knight movie. And the reason I hated it was the reason everyone loved it. It was Heath Ledger. His acting was the epitomy of abnoxious. It was sooo annoying to watch him. But then he died and everyone praised his acting even more. I am not a fan of Joker either. When I saw this movie's trailer I was like Oh my here we go again. Another annoying movie. I was not supposed to watch it. But after all the success and the reviews I decided to watch it, not in order to enjoy it but in order to see what everyone was talking about and have my own opinion. I was shocked because instead of watching a mehh movie I watched a masterpiece. I really do not understand why many governments banned this movie for people under 18 (it is not scary or gory) and I do not understand why people expected mass shootings or things like that. This is JUST A MOVIE. Not scarier than other movies I have watched. It is a movie about people with mental illnesses and about people who are neglected by their country and authorities. But what makes this movie really worth watching is Joaquin Phoenix. I like him as an actor but I never thought he was THAT good. He is excellent."
630,"There are moments here, where the lights in Joaquin Phoenix's / Arthur's eyes are so piercing, and so focused, that you are totally drawn into his performance and transformation into Joker. There are so many iconic scenes in this movie, so many, that, to me, make this film an instant classic.

And that's what Joker is."
631,"I've never been a Joaquin Phoenix fan, Til today that is. Finally, for once, the reviews on IMDB were truthful. There's a reason its rated an overall 9 on here. Not sure how anyone can rate it less than 10, but whatever, i'll take it. His performance in this film as Joker is nothing less than Oscar-worthy. I never thought I would actually be #teamjoker but I am. I'm not a comic reader so of course I never judge a movie based off of that. It was beautifully directed, and pointed a grim picture of what led up to Joker becoming Joker. Twists and turns in every direction. People complained that it took awhile to get going. NOT TRUE. I'm not going to go into a full synopsis of the film because you can read that on the main page. I'm just giving my thoughts. Best film of the year...if not the last 5 years that I have had the pleasure of watching. Movies have been trash lately, so its nice to finally see a gem like this. I'll say it again... OSCAR"
632,"My review has nothing to do with the phony controversy. I felt this movie, as a stand alone, was mediocre. The aesthetic of the film was well made. But, the acting by Phoenix annoyed me. I kept waiting for The Joker to show up - but he was very whiney and lame. The writing was not very good. Lots of plot convince. However, if they expanded on this universe and made it more interesting this could serve as a good origin story. I would like to see a Joker v Batman movie with this versions of Joker to expand the lore. Hopefully that comes."
634,"This film tells how the Joker comes to be the villain he is. The problem is that it is so effective and compelling, that I really empathise with the Joker and his horrible life experiences. Batman's father is portrayed as the villain, and the Joker is the victim. It juxtaposes good and bad. How is the next Batman film going to work, when Batman's now the son of the bad guy?"
636,"Bad acting, bad CG, and the story is just pathetic. Apparently the ability to laugh, smoke, lose weight and put on make up means great acting. Worst movie of the year, hands down."
638,"What a movie, the Joker is now among my top 3 of all time. This will go down as a Classic Masterpiece."
639,"It's beyond me why so many critics have panned and even encouraged people to skip this picture. I'm not exactly sure of why the vendetta's so personal; it's obviously struck a nerve . I'm taking critics less and less seriously since they rave about tripe like 'Lady Bird"" while trying to bludgeon a masterpiece like 'Joker'. This is the first ten I recall ever giving to a movie."
640,If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this it will only be because Hollywood is too sensitive. Probably best portrayal of the Joker yet...even though I still love Heath Ledger's version. This is just on another level! Would only warn against seeing this if you can't handle disturbing images/violence/dialogue. I have seen some of the worst cinema has to offer and I still got nervous sweats and felt incredibly uncomfortable the whole way through. Good luck!
641,"Joker is an incredible film and here's why.

Drama: In terms of drama did it make me cry? No. But that's not really what made it so sad. The Joker's life is unfairly sad and that's also what made this film have emotion. This movie and Joker himself was interestingly disturbing that can't really be explained, but you'll know what I mean if you've watched Joker.

Action: If you come to Joker looking for a good thrilling action movie, you won't get exactly that. Sure there's some thrilling action seen here, but I am glad that it isn't the main focus of the film, leaving it to the sad, disturbing life of Joker. Also when there is action it is very thrilling and exciting, adding to the drama too. Joker is an example that if you want an drama movie you can sprinkle some action into the film too with the drama staying the main focus, plus Joker is an example for fabulous action that isn't all explosions and machine guns (though sometimes that action is amazing, but many times not better than Joker's small fights.

Comedy: There is good comedy in Joker mainly from when he does his crazy things. But there is also good comedy from other sources like Murray/television guy.

Acting/directing: No wonder Joker's actor won the Oscar. He deserves it. He fabulously acted as the difficult role of Joker. Other side actors are excellent too. The director did a fabulous job at making Joker and is probably played a big part in what made the movie Joker the movie Joker.

Special effects: Not really much CGI to talk about as I don't believe there is too much and there isn't any really unique camera angles although there are some hard-to-keep-steady camera shots probably that the camera crew do good at. But I want to talk about the music. It is fabulous at matching the tone that Joker has. Especially what I believe are orchestra parts (I might be wrong about Joker's music containing an orchestra or orchestra instrument). But the music is just good and matches the tone.

I don't think I have anything left to say about Joker although I'm probably forgetting something. Oh well, I've wrote enough already and I'm sure you're tired of reading this if you've made it this far. Anyway all these amazing things about Joker are facts and make Joker an amazing movie that you need to watch RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!"
642,"Best comic book movie EVER hands down. The performances here are fabulous, as is the directing, soundtrack and story. Watch this!"
643,"Phoenix is a best joker ever he deserved oscar

This is a best movie of this year"
645,"I'm not a big fan of comics. But I am fan of everything around the pop culture that superheroes are. So I know a couple of things about Gotham and Batman.

My hype for this movie was because it's proclaimed as very violent and talks about mental issues. I love characters with mental health problems so watching this was awesome. The Joker it's the first movie with a low pacing and obviously not commercial that I would say it's my favorite of all times.

The third act of this movie it's golden. No spoilers but the ending left me shaking."
646,"So I grew up being a huge Batman fan, Naturally when I heard they were making a Joker film I was really excited. Went into this movie very excited and I was very let down. Honastly I thought the movie was boring, But it did have a few epic moments but overall it was just an ok movie"
647,"""Joker"" is highly derivative and a poor imitation of better Scorsese movies. The movie didn't really know what it was trying to say. On top of that it's very cynical and will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Great performance from Joaquin Phoenix but it's not essential viewing."
648,"All the silly kids and people masquerading as film buffs and critics, please just go back to watching your happy go lucky rom coms with happy endings. Just sit in your dark room with your keyboard and make as many comments as you like on marvel movies being the best things you've seen. Maybe even give your mother a shout for more meatloaf while you tell us your thoughts on how the best movies are all crap and delve into how profound Donnie darko was. Keyboard warriors always seem to have thee most ridiculous insights and views on movies. To say this movie is boring is a statement I will never get. And overrated? Don't get my started. There have been so much worse than this movie for that, try avatar, titanic, citizen Kane etc. Doesn't make them bad movies (with the exception of avatar) but apparently overrated means crap now. It's a huge movie franchise, of course it will be hyped up! We have another batman coming out already after only a few short years after the last one ffs. Do you think the marvel films or Star Wars will stop because there was an end game and ending to the skywalker saga? Nope. And do you think these movies wouldn't be overrated at some point? This movie DESERVES to be hyped up. Gotham has never looked more like it should as it does in both animation and in the Arkham game series. I would both love and probably hate there to be a sequel if you get my meaning. The joker is intriguing because of his mysterious past and beginnings, I think this was enough and if we did delve any further we would lose that mysteriousness, but you can't help a small part of you wanting to know more. I read one review where the guy watched it as a date night film and said they didn't like its dark nature and were bored. Who the hell watches this as date movie? Maybe a serial killer. Not exactly a movie to get u in the mood is it. Maybe try hostel or I spit on your grave for next week buddy. I should stop reading reviews on here, they just annoy me. It's worse than YouTube almost..."
649,"Getting straight to It, this film lived up to the hype and was a genuine masterpiece! Best film of 2019 by a country mile!

Anyone who has played the Joker has brought something different to make it their own, taking inspiration from different comic representations of the Clown Prince of Crime. Some fantastic (Heath Ledger), some not quite so much (Jared Leto).

Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal must be stamped as the definitive Joker origin story on screen. Certainly taking influence from some of the comic source material, but at the same time allowing itself the creative freedom to go in a few new directions.

It is at times; funny, painful, uncomfortable to watch, thrilling and captivating all at the same time. Phoenix's Oscar worthy performance is incredibly intense and he plays Arthur Fleck slowly reaching his mental breaking point with an agonising awkwardness.

When he casts aside his personal tragic baggage and embraces his Joker persona without resistance, Arthur Fleck's transformation is almost seen as liberating. From that point on, Joker is literally dancing to his own tune, with complete indifference to the world around him....he takes joy in his actions, and his own subjective, cruelly twisted perspective.

Whilst the film is firmly set in the DC universe (in 1981), with brief reference to the Wayne family tragedy with creates Batman, it still manages to have some poignant contemporary themes on class divide and social welfare.

A man in need of help, with genuine problems, is let down by society and allowed to fall through the cracks, becoming something far worse in process. A Joker who sees himself and the world around him as a cruel joke, with a savage punch line."
650,"Such a different kind of film it's hard to describe, but I'll try. Dark, twisted, humanly relatable, psychotic realism from the point of view of an impoverished society letting its citizens fall through the gaps. It's the perfect combination of uncomfortable, awkward, sad, and funny. I'm pretty sure I felt new untapped emotions without current names, like discovering a new species of animal. It's a work or art, not a super hero of anti-hero movie. Many will be disappointing, as a little of me was, but most of me was very very satisfied. Don't walk there with any expectations, just an open pallet and soak up the paint as it's brushed."
652,"This is a great film from start to end, Phoenix plays the part so well.

Let's be honest after Heath Ledgers performance, he had alot of boot to fill and alot of pressure on his shoulders, I believe he done good. I would still say Ledgers Joker is better imho but this is a different version but holds its own.

Not many other Villain solo films out there, I would say this is the best to date.

Enjoy."
655,From the acting to directing ... I'm stunned. An instant classic. Incredible movie.
656,"Just to say that the film left me wanting to watch ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver"" the whole time, plus a few of the other films that this film strongly references. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic however and the film has all the top production values that you'd expect of a big studio picture but it's generic and predicable in my opinion. It takes from so much that it's not it's own film for me. By no means is the film awful, it's just soulless. I'm not trying to be deliberately obtuse and against the tide of support for this film either, there are things as I've mentioned to commend and I'd like to add that going the way of gritty R rated film making is what I've wanted for years, from a more dramatic viewpoint, I thought ""Logan"" did what this film failed to do for me as a darker comic book oriented film. I hope people can respect my opinion just as I respect the free speech of everyone who really liked the film. Finally, I will add that those who have bashed the film for violence do not know what they're talking about. There are far more violent films than this and if one person or even a handful of people were incentivised to cause harm to others, the rest of us shouldn't have to pay for the odd few thank you very much. It's an interesting watch for certain and I'd recommend watching for that reason alone."
657,"I judge a movie by how many times I needed to fast forward through it. Joker set a record for me. I spent $6 on Amazon to watch this dull and duller movie. It is painful to see how many people wrote positive reviews. Who are they? What did they see? What did I miss? Yeah, I get the comments on society, etc., but so what?"
658,"As a kid growing up Joker was my favorite superhero villain and I always enjoyed seeing the different ways he was portrayed as. That being said, nothing tops this film. Phoenix gives one of the best performances of any film I have ever seen in my life. The writing is absolutely enchanting, dark, tight and extremely engaging. This movie blends psychological thriller, with crime mystery, and overall dark drama. The original score is about as perfectly made for a film as it can possibly get. Whenever it came on I notice the effect of the slow burn increasing suspense my heart rate would increase. The pacing in this movie is just fantastic, it flys by so quickly. I am still taking everything in, the symbolic elements, the meaning of it all and the ending especially the ending which is worth the price of admission. Joker is an extremely dark, and emotionally intense film that really is a lot to take in but it is so well done. Masterpiece!!!! Oscars make sure you watch this film and give it the awards it deserves!!!"
659,Joker is a brilliant piece of film making and an instant classic it will be spoke about for years to come and is officially my favourite film and will be watching it more and more as the years go by and carry on getting mesmerised by the great performances score and choreography in this gritty character study 10/10
660,"It's more like a drama that depicts evil bureaucracy in our society. Seems a little overhyped, but it's a good movie. It shows are different and how bad the lives of certain people are, and that we're to self-obsessed to take notice or/and care. Story of a man with a tragic life really. That's what this movie is in a nutshell. You don't need to think of so much more than that."
661,This movie is the one of the best movies I have ever seen
662,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance is very emotional, expressing pain with an uncontrollable giggling, making people sad. The film is very different from most previous superhero movies, with no special effects, no spectacles, or even too many action scenes. But in a slightly retro way, tell why the clown became that clown. In fact, it is a very serious film, including paying attention to social issues. The movie is kind of evil and will make you feel a little sympathy for this clown. In addition, this film should not be sequel and derivative, because it is still too real, if the character is re-comicized, it will no longer be him."
663,"Joker is a disturbing film with a riveting performance by Joaquin Phoenix as an unstable man making a living as a clown. He lives with and takes care of his mother who is crazier than he is. Robert DeNiro is cast as a Johnny Carson type of talk show host whose biggest fan is our hero clown. The violence is over the top but is necessary, much in the way it was in ""A Clockwork Orange,""another vicious but realistic film great from 1970. Kubrick' s masterpiece is an obvious influence on ""Joker"" but it is a worthy entry into this field of dystopian dramas. One of the ten best movies of 2020."
664,Phoenix makes a Good Joker. I say Good because the Film in itself could of been better. The Story and Plot could of done more to pull you in with interest. All and all good and entertaining
665,"Joker has probably one of the best depictions of mental illness I have ever seen on film. There's no point in comparing Joaquin Phoenix to Heath Ledger's portrayal, since these are two different interpretations of the character. As a character, Arthur Fleck is less of a criminal mastermind and more of a loner that feels put upon by society. And he eventually snaps like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. And therein lies my problem with this movie, there's a lot of Martin Scorsese pastiche in this film and sometimes it can come off as a bit too glib.

But Todd Phillips is a clever enough director to do some interesting things with his storytelling to make the film engaging. The film has a very grainy 70's look that makes it feel like a grindhouse movie from that era. I also love the super rat discussions on the radio, and I love the boiling tensions between the wealthy elites and the poor people of Gotham city, you get the sense that a class war could erupt in Gotham city at any minute. I also like that Todd Phillips made Thomas Wayne a smarmy prick, he's not the saintly Wayne like we're use to seeing in the other Batman movies.

This version of Thomas Wayne is less of a philanthropist and more of a slimy politician. It was a bold choice to make this character something else entirely and it's wickedly subversive. Zazie Beetz is also great in a small role as Sophie Dumo the object of Arthur's desire.

In conclusion, I wish Joker was longer because even at 115 minutes it feels a bit rushed. Perhaps they could have fleshed out Arthur Fleck's relationship with his mother a bit more? But despite my quibbles, this is still a good movie elevated by Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck. Ultimately, Joker is a character study about a deeply troubled man and this film is definitely worth seeing."
666,"Some great moments, doesn't really live up to the hype though. Phoenix's prediction of Joker's descent into madness was really interesting to watch and he will get many plaudits but the film felt like it was missing something. A few plot holes and areas where you feel like it's being dragged out longer than it needs to be. Definitely worth a watch, but don't go in expecting to see a 'film of the year'. Ledger still on top."
669,"Wow ! I'll be honest that I did not expect this one to live up to the hype, but it did. We've been overdue on having a proper masterpiece film out there and this one delivers. A movie that causes you to think and still leaves you thinking about why those events happened in the film or even real life. Leaves you thinking about why it's important to know both sides of a situation - of course this is a lesson that the Batman lore has always had, hence the villains having interesting backstories. There's so much to take in with this film, did you ever expect that from a comic book movie ? Much less a DC film ?! Batman has always been (to me at least) the most interesting story in the comic book world, because the villains are as interesting (if not more) than the hero. So many film adaptations have been made, but this one finally does an outstanding job exploring the story's most complex character. Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the praise for his take on this character. He got the mannerisms, looks, and ticks of a mentally unstable person down to a T, it's so natural and not cheesily forced - the guy is phenomenal. Whether people like it or not, we needed this film. No matter if you're part of the overly sensitive brigade that censors everything or an online edgelord who mocked this film for critiquing sOciEty, you need to watch this film - there's a valuable lesson in it for both of you. This is one of the greatest films that has come out in this decade. Congrats to the whole team who made it possible, outstanding job !"
670,"It has excellent acting cinematography, sound design, production design, colouring and of course acting. It is close to a masterpiece. It may even be one of this year's best movies. It cannot be easily compared with superhero movies as it has its own unique expression.

Where this movie lacks; is making the final jump. Although the elements are there, the final jump seems a little forced. We know who Joker is and we saw who he was and WHY he became Joker. But the metamorphosis has a small gap.

Also the Joker we see; is immature yet, so the elements of his dark philosophy are missing.

I would definitely recommend this movie as piece of art, to all mature audiences."
671,So after a long time I finally watched Joker and I'm honest I never thought I would like a Joker movie whitout any real action. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix is the core in this movie and absolutely breathtaking. It also shows that mental illness is a serious illness wich people often don't see as serious. The soundtrack is so amazing it definitely has the dark DC vibe. I can only recommend this movie.
672,"It's not a 10/10. If you watch the trailers you can some what predict where the films going at a certain point. Great supporting cast especially if you are a fan of standup. The cinematography is great. Joaquin Phoenix can do anything. Without Phoenixs performance, the film might not of been able to pull the complex turns with the character in the way that was needed. I got the sense that he carried the movie and for the most part, kept it from collapsing on itself."
673,"Acting 10/10 Actors 10/10 Sound 8/10 Soundtrack 9/10 Dolby Atmos 6/10 Drama 9/10 Action 3/10 Suspense 9/10 Story 10/10

Conclusion: When you ever want to know why exist joker and batman you must see this film.

Jaquin phoenix play his role very intense he play the feelings of the character authentic i never think about that the character is not real i look outside and i can find one normal person who can have the problems from the playing character. Joker is more than a dc story joker is the mirror of the society."
674,"Joker was a great Origin movie that actually was not an origin story. This movie is not for marvel fans who laughs the predictable childish jokes of marvel movies. the movie has lots of jokes from Joker but each of them gives you a thought instead of laugh. the laugh of Joker gave me mixed feelings each time i heard he didnt copy what Heath did but he created brilliant style of his own. this story line still caries a lot of things from the comic books which i can not spoil here. Joaquin played an excellent character here. You literally see his changes and craziness in his eyes through out the movie. How can he succeed that transform is beyond my understanding. Directing also deserves an Oscar just because Todd made a great work to show us how once poor man becomes a mass murdering killer. The story-line was fluid with some twists which made even more better.

And last thing that people are wondering! Who is better Joker? Joaquin or Heath? My opinion that would not be a correct comparison. Joaquin portrayed a normal man who became Joker, while Heath was already playing an established character Joker. Even though both played the same character, Joker has transformation and character thorough out his time. In my humble opinion Joaquin also deserved Oscar.But both of them did a fantastic job for playing such a hard character. I am planning to see it again."
675,"Not a great film, very Hollywood version of the original."
676,"So this comes from someone who is not into Super Hero movies and the like but when he one the Oscar for bets Actor, I decided to watch it . This is outstanding.Yes it's dark and a bit disturbing at times, but it can also be taken as a life lesson to us all .

Extraordinary acting performance from Phoenix and well worth his Oscar."
677,"Whilst the acting was fine (maybe not subtle enough to be great) it wasn't a particularly gripping film and made me wonder what the hype was about. Maybe unique in trying to introduce a comic book viewing audience into a less action packed and slightly more serious film. I guess such audiences may describe it as 'mature' or 'deep' but an adult with moderately broad movie tastes certainly wouldn't. Maybe worth a watch, but don't go out of your way."
678,"Phoenix is great. The cinematography as well. That's it.

The world described in the film is not realistic, despite what they try to *tell* you. They don't show, they never show. Everything that happens is finalized to sustain Fleck's downfall. It's not organic, it feels forced. A lot of ideas, none of them explored sufficiently.

The movie is basically an amalgamation of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Too many scenes that were ""inspired"" by those two great masterpieces, that deal with these matters in an actual thoughtful and mature way. This truly is the ""we live in a society"" film.

I wanted to like it, I really did. I couldn't. I'm sorry? Go cry in the corner, if you're offended by my opinion."
679,"Dark, depressing and thought provoking. Joaquin's performance is stunningly perfect. He is the embodiment of Joker."
680,"So one could say this is an origins story as it's not your usual superhero fair, not that Batman has any superpowers and is just a regular joe with a tonne of money. Joker is a brilliant movie which in itself explores the subject matter of mental health and me thinks is setup for a much needed sequel."
681,"""Joker"" is not a comic-book movie. It's a gritty, psychological thriller that delves into the mind of one lonely man, who is subject to the cruelties and neglect of society, and finally dissolves into a path of insanity that leaves him irredeemable. It's unsettling and so grounded in reality that while it does take some inspiration from ""Killing Joke"", Todd Phillips generates an original story that ultimately reinvents the character of the Joker.

That being said, a comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker is just not applicable. Firstly, it's an origin story so that immediately removes the aura of mystery Ledger's Joker. The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" is just a being of unknown origin, present to wreck havoc and be the perfect antithesis to what Batman stands for. ""Joker"" is about a lonely man named Arthur Fleck who gradually descends to into a being of madness who happens to be called the ""Joker"". He's not really the Joker from the comics. Perhaps that's because it's an origin story so that some of his most defining characteristics like his charm and genius-intellect are not fully-fleshed out yet. I totally respect the decision to totally reinvent the Joker, but I missed those aspects of the character, and ultimately, I'm hesitant to call Arthur Fleck the Joker.

Despite the radically different character, Joaquin Phoenix slays his portrayal of this man. This movie is a showcase of his performance and cements the fact that the Joker is probably, if not already, the most coveted comic-book character to be portrayed in cinema. There are side characters portrayed by Robert DeNiro, Zazie Beetz, etc. However, this is Phoenix's show and his performance was brilliant, haunting, disturbing and moving. His interpretation of the Joker laugh is so nuanced, that it's more than just a trademark of a character. You can see and hear the pain, sadness, anger from his laughs as he ponders whether his life is a tragedy or comedy. He brought new dimensions to the Joker character, leading us at one point to empathize with him, his sorrow, and we watch helplessly as his character just falls into a path of no return.

The script is well-polished and I appreciate that it takes its time and opts for a slow pace to ensure that Arthur Fleck's transition is natural, not forced and abrupt. The result is a dark brooding thriller which I feel can be segmented into two parts; the first of which depicts the crumbling of the wall between Arthur Fleck and insanity, followed by the latter half where things get unsettling and ramps up to accommodate Arthur's full transformation. Some scenes are disturbing, but that's what you'd expect to see in a movie that aims to delve into the mind of someone like the Joker. I do feel the main story arc is a bit too predictable, particularly in the second half of the movie. There's not a lot of impactful twists. That said, the score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is brilliant, as it compliments the dark atmosphere of the movie very well, with its sorrowful melodies and haunting background. It is music you don't want to listen to alone.

All in all, ""Joker"" is a really good movie, and a very brave one too, bringing in topics that are relevant today. It brings to light the subjects of mental illness, and social neglect of those affected by the former. I'm not sure if it's really trying to make a statement about it, whether it's trying to say that anyone, if pushed enough, can be someone like the Joker. That would sort of take the ""special"" out of the Joker's character. It's definitely not the typical comic-book movie and the Joker here is not the Joker you typically know. But it is a very good psychological character study of a man crumbling to madness, powered by the brilliant performance of Joaquin Phoenix."
682,"8.5/10

I was gripped from the offset, even during the relatively slow segments. I think this was mainly because the Joker's character is intriguing, in addition to the great storyline and the unpredictability.

*Pros*

Strong opening. The opening scene was powerful and gave us a great introduction to the Joker.
Engaging story. I particularly liked the contrast between his life, and the fact he's always laughing / smiling all the time. And the reference to how people expect those with mental illness to act a certain way (whereas in Arthur's reality he has a facade).


*Cons*

To explain, I felt the movie just dramatically ended with a lot of loose ends left unaddressed (e.g. the apartment incident, the storyline with his neighbour, and the times on the clocks throughout). However, the most prominent fan theory offers a possible explanation as to why it was so abrupt. If that theory is true, then it would have been beneficial to end the movie with a quick flashback to different segments in the story to clarify. In a similar format to how 'The Prestige' was done.


To conclude, if they had tied up the end of the movie more nicely, I would have probably bumped the rating up a point. Although - all in all, it's a really enjoyable movie. With a great story, that was told really well."
683,"I liked the acting but the story was slow and took a while to progress, it feels more like an art movie version of the joker than the traditional depictions of the character."
684,"This film is the reason cinema was invented, fantastic story, really fantastic vision, cinematography and direction. Amazing performances by all cast and gripping film score. Deserve its billion dollar return. Massive well done to all involved"
686,"What are folks going on about and giving this a 10 that's ridiculous. It's mediocre-at-best I will admit Phoenix, his performance is melancholy and ferocious. But I've come to expect the best from Joaquin. I was loaned this from a neighbor, I am so grateful that I didn't go out and spend hard-earned dollars on this product. My favorite collateral superhero comic book character is Batman and I prefer the Chris Nolan Batman. it was slow and dragged in parts. Robert De Niro was superfluous I also borrowed a little lesser-known flick called Lighthouse with William Dafoe much more satisfaction."
687,"I'd say that this movie is the best that I've seen this year. It took a turn from the cute and fun Joker that Jared Leto provided to a Mind blowing Joker of Joaqin Phoenix. It was stunningly beautiful, but very disturbing that I'm almost unable to finish half the movie. The cinematography is good if not the best, but what got me is Joaqin's movements, the expression on his face, the time of his breathing, and his eyes. I have stopped watching horror films because they fail to scare me. They just surprise me with sudden photos and loud music. This one literally gave me goosebumps and I had the creeps even after the show. For some weird reason, I was scared.

DC has been a disappointment for me for the past years. This one gave me hope for better DC movies. I think they should focus more on the villains.

Describe this move in one word: Haunting"
688,"Joker is one of my favorite films of 2019. I thought this was a pretty tight script, don't have any issues with the writing of this film. While Joaquin Phoenix doesn't surpass Heath Ledger, I think he definitely made this role his own, I loved his performance, and I think he deserves an Oscar nomination. Along with Adapted Screenplay and perhaps Best Picture. This film is very much so inspired by Martin Scorsese and his films, Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, and it compliments those films in a loving way. I personally didn't think it was derivative of those films and I personally liked it more than The King of Comedy. All the other performances were great, the film was beautifully shot, the cinematography and shot composition were great. I loved the score, this is all around just a very well acted drama that's a very deep, psychologically disturbing, and well written character study. I cannot wait to see it again."
689,"This movie is significantly overrated. I watched and I was bored. All this misery, darkness and I was hoping for some light, but ended in same misery as started. So basically this movie about nothing. Has no plot. Three stars is for acting. Zero stars for everything else"
691,"""Joker"" was definitely not what I expected it to be. Joaquin Phoenix does a good job but ultimately I thought Heath Ledger was a better Joker. I was speechless watching a lot of the scenes and what keeps me from giving it a perfect score is I feel at times Phoenix was way over the top and a lot of it is in poor taste."
693,"No joke this is by far the best movie that I've ever watch in my entire life and surpassing the magnificent movie 'Seven' (1995). At first I felt bad for the protagonist Arthur Fleck but when he starting to change into becoming the Joker I felt terrified of him which is amazing that the movie accomplished that. This movie is also not for everyone because of the lack of action and always annoys me when people saying this movie is bad with the reason of ""This movie is boring"". I really recommend you who likes a good story but I do not recommend this to the people who just want action like every Marvel movie."
694,"Yeah, they did turn the archetype of arch enemy into the anti hero but I was expecting that in a solo movie. I'm sure everyone has had that moment when the world pushes them too far and you wanted to push back as hard as you felt they pushed you, but instead of doing that you go and watch the movie Joker. especially with others who understand how your feel. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant in this film. Too bad with all the controversy he won't win an Oscar form it. It's the perfect academy award winning movie too, Phoenix as the Joker out shines he movie but unlike other Oscar contenders this year like Judy, The movie shines pretty brightly on it's own. Loved the connection between the Joker and his greatest enemy that could have went badly but it worked out well. It's a slow movie but I found Phoenix humorous. Not a violent as I though more like a lot intent for violence then small quick burst of it. I understand how this movie could be looked at as a bad stigma for the mentally ill, but for me, the flick easily told a tale of frustration and anger for anyone who knows what it truly feels like to be pushed around. It's good that he does not randomly target anyone, Anyone that get hurt by the joker is someone who (he felt) hurt him. It's the perfect origin of a supervillain. Overall it's worth it to see that transformation."
696,"Yea nothing original in this movie. i'm sure todd was a big taco driver

people will act they love it and when it comes on hbo they will not be able to make it through a rewatch.if this movie was named ""clown"" half the audience wouldn't have made it through the first viewing.

yea good actors can act... but the most impressive thing is how great a cash grab this was by making a inexpensive blockbuster with only a few mouths to feed."
697,"The movie is so great

It's another view of Joker. But so true and well done.

Joaquin deserves the Oscar. Will see if tomorrow they'll assign it to him.

The film is s crescendo of pathos and actions. Picture, music, photography, scenes, plot, all is great.

Frankly I suggest you to watch it."
698,"Oaquin's role as the joker was excellent! The rest of the movie, I didn't think it was so bad"
699,"I'm surprised so many people actually liked this movie with many giving it 10 out of 10, however everyone is entitled to their opinion so I accept some people really enjoyed this movie. Personally I went in with high expectations as I know Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor & even in this movie it is clear he is a talented actor, however the most important thing in any movie is how the story is told & for me who is a fan of this genre I simply did not enjoy how this long drawn out story was told. It is interesting to see how people can see a movie completely differently to other movie fans, as all forms of art are subjective but for me I did not enjoy this at all."
700,"Amazing acting! This guy deserves all the awards !! J. Phoenix portrays Joker in an amazing way and it locks the audience in this emotional drama/tragedy. Great casting, wonderful compilation of music, amazing acting ! What can we say? He deserves the academy award in every possible way ."
702,"Everything about this film is just superb. The atmosphere, the photography, the pace and story itself but last and certainly not least Joaquin Phoenix. His performance is mesmerising and amazing. His body, thin and contorted, his face, his eyes... Although he's acting it never feels fake and every inch of his body is telling the story. It could almost be a silent movie and you would still get it. It is an origins film but it could easily stand on it's own as the close up story of a man's descent into madness. It is haunting and a masterpiece."
705,"Forget about the critics! They always bash DC for being too 'dark' and, in this case, for promoting violence and mental illness.

Enough with the lame joke-infested Marvel type of movies targeted towards kids. The world needs to appreciate the more serious movies that tend to focus on crucial cinematic elements (in particular, plot and character development).

This film is no where close to boring as it really shows you the Joker's transition whilst emitting a disturbing vibe that will leave you cringing simply from Joaqin's phenomenal acting."
707,"Let's give Joaquin Phoenix a huge applaud, he delivered one of the hardest roles in history, such a mesmerizing and amazing performance, this is something that we will remember for years! Heath ledger would be proud. Much darker version than I'd expected, the movie definitely reached my expectations, with the realistic, dark and gore joker. They finished the loose ends and made us realize how ""joker"" was made, all of the physicality and emotional depth that triggered Arthur Fleck's inner joker was stunning and pure, the movie also had one of the best character development in movie history, this is such a role to remember!!"
710,"Look. It's a really good movie. The acting is impeccable and Phoenix presents the Joker in an interesting and unique way. It's fascinating to watch, the third act is earth-shattering, and you leave the movie feeling stunned.

That. Being. Said. Way too many people are taking the wrong message away from this. As though the Joker is meant to be relatable, or send a message about bullying or something. He's not. There is obviously a heavy ""society is cruel to those in need"" message but this movie is about the origins of a psychopath and it's a little scary that so many people see it as... I don't know... inspiring?

Just watch the movie and then try to distance yourself from its fans."
711,"Arthur Fleck lives a simple and very meagre existence. He cares for his mum and loves his job, but things go wrong and he loses control, and another side of his personality rises up. In a way it's a tale of the ""haves and have nots"", in a bleak setting. Arthur doesn't ask for much he just wants to be happy, but there's usually someone to upset his world. Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job of playing Arthur Fleck who suffers from an intellectual disability. From delivering his dialogue, mannerisms and facial expressions Joaquin Phoenix nails it all. The pacing of the movie is good, the story is told well, and the support actors/characters are good. A dark and disturbing movie, the best drama/thriller movie of the last 10 years."
712,"Joker is a standalone origin story of the eponymous DC Comics villain from the Batman series. Starring Joaquin Phoenix in the title role and directed and co-written by Todd Phillips, it is a brilliant, enthralling depiction of a man's descent into madness and the effects it has on those around him.

In 1981 in Gotham City, mentally ill Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) takes care of his ailing mother in their run-down apartment while working a menial job as a clown. Being isolated from society, Arthur struggles to fit in with those around him, frequently bullied and beaten up by several unruly people. Determined to make something of himself, Arthur tries laughing his way through his ever-mounting problems to become a successful comedian and leave an impression on the world, no matter how far he must go to get his point across.

As shocking as it is engaging, Joker succeeds spectacularly by showcasing a realistic character study of a madman and how often individuals like this are ignored by society. Throughout the film, it seems every character Arthur Fleck encounters is either a hypocrite, a liar, disingenuous, or all of the above. Each moment of his collapsing mental state is shown with intricate care, never once seeming like it is all happening at once but instead as one bad situation after another. This draws comparisons to the characters of Travis Bickle from ""Taxi Driver"" and Rupert Pupkin in ""The King of Comedy"", both of which were social rejects who resorted to more sinister means of gaining attention.

Joaquin Phoenix simply owns the role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, practically besting Heath Ledger in almost every way, which is saying quite a lot considering the long-lasting impact Ledger's portrayal has left on pop culture. Phoenix's dark sunken eyes and skinny frame (whom he reportedly lost 24 kgs/52 lbs in preparation) works to his advantage and adds so much tragic pathos to the character while at the same time showing him as someone we should avoid idolising. This could easily be the role of his career and he deserves every bit of praise he earns.

Martin Scorsese, who was initially attached as an executive producer, has clearly left his influence all over this film, with several of his cinematic techniques worked into the final product. Director Todd Phillips, best known for directing The Hangover trilogy, handles this film surprisingly well, implementing several of Scorsese's trademarks, from the jarring bursts of graphic violence to the murky cinematography of downtown Gotham City. It almost seems like this film is being used as an allegory for any controversy that some of Scorsese's work may have been indirectly responsible for, like how ""Taxi Driver"" inspired John Hinckley Jr. to shoot President Ronald Reagan to impress Jodie Foster.

Overall, while I do think this film is excellent, I must take care in whom I recommend it to. This needs to be viewed with the correct mindset, understanding that the actions of Arthur Fleck should never be admired and taken at face value. Anybody who unironically believes that Arthur has done nothing wrong by the end should seek the professional help they urgently need.

I rate it a perfect 10/10"
713,THE ROLE OF JOKER PLAYED BY JOAQUIN PHOENIX IS JUST BRILLIANT AND ITS A DARK MOVIE WHICH ADRESSES THE PROBLEMS WHICH THE JOKER FACES IN HIS LIFE JOURNEY AND ITS A BEAUTIFUL STORY WITH AN AMAZING DIRECTION.
715,"Before I start this review, I just want to say that I am not very well versed in comic book law or canon, so I will not be reviewing the accuracy of the Jokers origin story in relation to the comics. Now on with the review...

This film is sensational! Everything about this film is brilliant, I can hardly find any fault in it! Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent and is deserving of an Oscar nomination in the very least, and from what I've seen of films this year he should probably win the Oscar at this moment, he is mesmeric every time he is on screen, which is the majority of this film, you cant take your eyes off him. Obviously his performance is going to get compared to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker and that for me is not unwarranted, I'm not saying it's as good as one of the best performances ever in cinema, but the fact you are able to draw a comparison between the two tells how good Joaquin Phoenix is. The way the character is portrayed and written is very powerful, it's written in such a way that in the beginning you feel sympathy for this character and you almost side with him, meaning when it comes to the end of the film you almost feel personally responsible for the monster he's become.

This movie is very dark and goes to some extremely dark places and really makes you think about our world and our society and for a comic book movie to do that is something special and very refreshing. On to the only fault I could find with this movie and its not even a fault about the film, and that is I cannot believe this film is a 15, for me watching this film the use of violence is very powerful very gory and frequent enough in my eyes to warrant an 18 rating, and that's not to say if your 15 you're not mature enough to watch it, I'm purely comparing it to other 18 rated films and in my eyes it should be an 18.

The score, soundtrack, and cinematography on display in this film is masterful, some of the shots you see are works of art and there's a sequence towards the end of the film that tracks the titular character through Gotham which is particularly beautiful. The score is fantastic, and it does something similar to Into the Spider-verse, whereby it uses the same score throughout, but the score slowly swells and swells to a crescendo at the end of the film which really puts you back into your seat. The soundtrack accompanies the score and the film beautifully and changes with the character's descent into madness.

All in all, believe the hype for this film, you will not be disappointed it truly is a masterpiece and an exceptional piece of film making, which will surely stand the test of time, go and watch this film as soon as you can!

10/10"
717,"I had quite high expectations regarding this film and was not disappointed one bit when I got a chance to watch it.

Phoenix is brilliant, so is the film's score and overall Scorsese-sque tone. This is not a superhero (or rather villain) film, nor your usual antihero flick. It's a deeper look into what could happen to a person when they feel they don't belong."
718,"Yes, drop the constant music and let us think. We can, we will. Lose the losers like de weirdo and let the main characters flourish. The talk show added nothing but extra time to this movie. If you are reading this and considering whether or not to invest the time in this movie, give it 30 minutes and you'll appreciate the great story more. I know you will be tempted to stop in the first 15 minutes but it does flow better later/"
719,"Unbelievably awful film about a loser. The fact that the Joker has made more than US$ 1 billion tells me that society has a whole is as sick and demented as The Joker himself. Depressing, violent and pointless. It is impossible to feel sorry for Arthur, he is just human garbage."
720,"This movie blew me away and I feel guilty for not watching it until now.

Dark Emotive Funny Evocative

I loved it... Phoenix was incredible as the Joker, even better than Ledger in The Dark Knight.. I loved him, felt sorry for him, supported him and laughed at him.

Do yourself a favour and enjoy these two hours!!. Every actor played their part in a superb movie."
721,"To be honest I was not a fan of this solo Joker movie because I knew that if it were to be a success then people will start relating the Joker to Arthur Fleck.

In my opinion the Clown Prince of Crime should not get a proper back story. That uncertainty behind his past is one of the things that makes this character so interesting.

But whatever they have done here in this movie is amazing. The reason for Joker's grudge against the bat was something that we have all wondered about. They have explained the reasons here beautifully. The theater response was pretty positive during that reveal. So bat fans need not worry.

Joaquin Phoenix begins as a semi lunatic and initially I did not very much like the character. However by the end he becomes a full blown psycho and the acting goes up by some notches once he puts the Joker make up on. The final 30 minutes are a must watch.

Orchestra deserves special mention. Spine chilling music at crucial moments.

Overall it's a dark toned film where we see someone who despises the society (especially bcoz of what it does to him) and loses his 'life' and mind in the process. It's also interesting that the film reminded me about Taxi Driver which is one of my favorite films. Robert De Niro who nailed that role plays a pretty decent part in this film too.

Verdict: Slightly sadistic but beautifully crafted movie. Oscar contender for sure."
723,"Before talking about the movie, I must first say that movie critics are absolute airheads. Unless a film has a happy plot and positive message you can almost guarantee that it will get bashed by multiple critics. IMBD is the only rating you should go by because it is based on us the people and not some idiotic judgement by a pompous critic. Anyways enough of that, this movie is absolutely amazing! Everything from the acting, music score, and setting is none short of perfection. Joaquin Phoenix has set a new standard for acting and if he does not win an Oscar for this then the movie industry is doomed. I felt every emotion that he worked so hard on to display to an audience. Which I must applaud because the level of dedication displayed here deserves to recognized. I won't spoil any of the movie but, I will say to just go see it! You will not be disappointed!

10/10 - I apologize for being blunt but if you are rating this low. Then stay off this page and stick to your brainless (new MIB, Oceans, Ghostbusters etc. ) movies filled with CGI crap!"
724,"Wow, what a superb story line, cinematography was first class, and a true acting masterclass. Wow. Loved it 👍👍"
725,"I can see how a privileged normie will see this and think ""oh no, this will inspire the lower, unprivileged class to be violent towards us"" but if you have a few brain cells to scrape together, as well as some empathy you can totally understand what this was about - and it ain't that.

A sweet, though mentally struggling, mentally abused man trying to be a light in the darkness of society is only getting punished for it until he's unwillingly pushed into things he would never possibly want to do, such as cause harm.

An invisible man becomes visible. There's plenty of us who are invisible, and plenty of you who have your brainless followers and think you're the center of the universe. Even if you're not that famous you're still arrogant enough to consider yourself special because you're in Hollywood. How could you possibly understand this movie?

This movie was perfectly timed in an age where mainstream media and Hollywood celebrities who smell their own far7s all day and virtue signal on Twitter while knowing nothing about life outside of a mansion - daily demonize what they view as lower class, and inexplicably, men in general. Especially emotionally fragile men like Joker. So I see why some of the same mainstream media grasped for straws in order to twist this masterpiece into one of their little ""controversies"" in order to deter the same people they hate from watching a movie, finally, one movie, they could possibly relate to - because the struggle to survive and be kind while being deemed a low class freak is portrayed scary realistic."
726,"I get the impression that the character Phoenix portrayed was not all that much of a stretch for him. The film is entertaining enough despite it's glaring predictability. How many more Joker films do we need though? Yes, kiddies, that was rhetorical."
727,But by far not the cineastic gem that I have expected. The story is way to formulaic to impress and its twists are therefore not very surprising. But Phoenix acting is really worth to watch it. that is it.
729,"Hi, everyone I just checked out ""Joker"" and know I get why this one is so divisive. You see, Joker is already a thing. It is in the news, people love it for its message, others say it's political garbage and me:

Joker is... actually pretty good.

Let's get the easy stuff out of the way. Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular, mad, chaotic, out of this world. ""Joker"" is a great addition to his monumental collection of gorgeous performances, among with ""The Master"", ""Her"", 'Walk the Line"", ""Sisters Brothers"" and I could go on for days. He is a moving force, an unstoppable dynamite and there is a reason why I keep saying that he is the best actor ever. He is so committed and into the role, laughs like Eddie Murphy(actually far better), dances like John Travolta, he truly becomes the Joker. A huge Bravo from me to his majesty!

The movie is actually really well-shot, the framing and the subtle camera movement, the stylish lense flair or the atmospheric, blurry in and out of focus, all add a lot of personality to the film, make it a feast for the eyes and distinguish from the everyday ""box-office fan flick"". The soundtrack is insane, the score, the energy that movie brings, wow. And yes the credits do nail it.

Ok, and know the story. Joker is honest,true,realistic,risky and bold, but also has its cliches and dump stuff, plus i can see the haters boing on this one a lot. But trust me, I think its risks are for the better.

Joker is a depiction of the social and political situation we are living in this moment. Gotham is a dark place, full of unkind and selfish people, fake news, ""happy"" shows and ""glamorous"" politicians who aim at changing things. And I really mean it, Gotham an our world don't really differ. I think about it and see it everyday, people just doing their thin, ignoring the lives of others, we have lost a part of our humanity through the years, we avoid greeting, we ignore the poor and beggars, we have built a wall of classes and politicians never do anything for that. I am not such of a politics guy, I hardly read any articles about politics, but I cannot avoid the fact that the world has turned into a ark and lonely one, one in which is ruled by the important and famous ones, the ones that ""matter"", it is a black hole, a rubbish dump, as the film suggests . Joker is a person who has suffered form his childhood and is bullied, lied by the others, he has never really felt actual joy for something, he is suffering and in it not even his fault. The socieiety judge him and makes fun f him, he is barely noticed and the only relationship he shares is the one with his mother. He is a product of this cruel society and he is treated so badly, so the society makes him the Joker, a insane man. He decides to become important, to change things to beat cruelty with chaos and this is his world and even I don't approve his actions, well they are understood. Hate provokes hate, violence leads to nothing but violence. Joker was just Arthur, a dude who wanted to be a comedian and bring joy to people, but his pathisis and .the people around him turned him into Joker. And Joker wants to show that that the world is wrong. That it's the world that insane and he is the sane one. He faces a world full of mean and gridy people, who want to make everything look happy and nice through the telly and the shows and the ads and we must hide our porblems and sadness and ignore the sadness and despair around us, because the ones in the high place will fix it and everyone says ""DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY"", ""KEEP CALM"", ""JUST DO IT"", like it is an easy thing to do, but no it isn't. And you know, I kind of agree. He is the monster the world created. The world has to pay for the mistakes of every person and system that never cared for anyone, that made everything an ""industry"" and left the humanity behind. We are a mad, unfair, cruel and a self-destructive for sure. We deserve everything and we must face the awful truth. It just takes a clown to do that.

And I just imagined gathering all the presidents and kings and political party's and showing this film in a special screening or something. Just think if their reactions. They would hate to see the truth in front of their eyes, they would hate it. And apparently,so does every big critic's website and newspaper. ""Social commentary at its worst"", ""Political junk"", they call it. I call these critics what Venom called Eddie Brock in that elevator scene. It is funny, isn't it? The film has actually bedcome what it represents. People love it, consider worth of thinking and discussing, while the industrial sites and websites boo it and give it a negative glance. Just like Joker himself.

And I cannot wait to find what the big award shows, like the Oscars, will think of this film. Will they give it any nominations or ignore it because of its political ideology? From the one side, the film is really well-received and it has had a huge appeal, but from the other side its political and social ideologies are far too big and honest for American Tv.

Okay, still it is not perfect. There some really cheesy shots and sequences, but in order to fully express my bags with I need to go to spoilers, which I won't. I am actually going to post a spoiler review for the film to get in-depth.

Joker is a really good movie. It is brilliantly shot and directed, it has a distinct personality, especially when compared to other ""superhero films"", it is works perfect as character study and the political and social commentary makes it quite tasteful. And, last but not least, Joaquin Phoenix proves for one more time that he is a monumental ""performer"".

Call me mad, but I think that this film is quite prophetic and might also have to a small but important change and for the better. a world where we will have a reason to laugh, live and

Smile

But, the true question is... is it better than Venom?

Only time will tell"
731,"Joker is a drama movie in the vein of movies like Taxi-Driver and King of Comedy, It is a horror movie without any jump-scares or any other horror movie tropes and it is a comic-book origin movie about the most notorious and iconic villain. This movie will make you uncomfortable very often but ultimately it will force upon you some difficult questions that most movies shy away from asking. This is one of the few comic-book movies which will force you to think for hours after you have seen it.

Joker is a movie about Arthur Fleck (played brilliantly by ""Joaquin Phoneix"") who had some psychopathic tendencies but due to deteriorating conditions of Gotham and certain events that took place in the span of the movie leads him to lose it completely and become the villain we all know as Joker. The movie in its 2-hour runtime focuses completely on Arthur Fleck and shows his descent into becoming the joker and that journey is very well showcased, sometimes it is so realistic that some might consider it almost horror-like. The main credit goes to Joaquin Phoneix for such brilliant acting definitely Oscar-worthy, he is the main reason that the journey is believable you may feel bad for the character but you will also be able to feel the darkness deep inside which endorse his actions, the darkness which is slowly unravelled throughout the span of the movie. The rest of the supporting casts were great as well especially Robert De Niro.

The movie is directed by Todd Philips who before this had only directed movies like Hangover and Due date. This movie was a great departure from his usual type of movies but he pulled it off, you could tell he is a big Scorsese fan as this movie is heavily inspired by Taxi Driver. Like Taxi Driver this movie is a bit of a slow burner and slowly picks up the pace which really helps in understanding the character a lot better especially since this movie was a character study. As the descent into madness started so does the pacing of the movie.

The cinematography was very beautiful, the tone of the movie really helped in showcasing the deteriorating Gotham and characters. The soundtrack of the movie was also very good again I think it was very similar to Taxi Driver, It wasn't omnipresent, though when played it increased the tension very easily.

I am really glad that a movie like this exists. When comic-book movies are so saturated it is important that we have directors and actors who take risks like these. Projects like these (if successful) could break the monotony that has shrouded the comic-book genre. You may not end up liking the movie but that should not stop you from recognising it for its uniqueness and its bold take. Having said that I really loved this movie to bits and would love to see it again and again for its mesmerising performances, beautiful cinematography, lovely score and especially for its unique take."
732,"Looking at this from a business perspective...the career move that director Todd Phillips made was brilliant. It was a brilliant move but I wasn't totally certain it would make for a brilliant film - I wasn't sure if he had it in him. As he's stated in recent interviews, he hit a point where he felt he could no longer make crude comedies for an American audience, which is what he's been known for (The Hangover trilogy, Old School, etc), and I feel that completely. So where do you go from there? Considering comic book movies are one of the only types of movies that get large production budgets in 2019, he takes an iconic comic book character, takes one of the most intense and interesting A-list actors we have working, and instead of making another carbon-copy, commercialistic, and fully forgettable CGI-fest full of fart jokes and giant robots getting knocked over, he makes a movie with some actual psychological depth! What a way to work around this troubled system! One must generally adapt in order to capitalize.

As far as the film itself, I knew Phillips and Phoenix would create something entertaining, but I could not have expected the sheer masterpiece they pulled off. From every angle... the writing, the directing, the editing, the photography, the pacing - it's all impeccable and I am beyond impressed. There's not a dull moment and every single scene plays an important role in the tension-building and the unfolding of every little plot element. And, of course, the acting... this could be very well be the greatest performance of Joaquin Phoenix's career, which is a colossal statement considering his mountain of phenomenal films, and the fact that he might be my #1 of this era. Literally every shot where Phoenix is on the screen disperses an outpour of complex emotions - never just one, always a smorgasbord, like when you've eaten half an eighth of mushrooms and they've just begun kicking in, and you feel entirely overwhelmed. There were more psychological twists than I was expecting and they had me pretty stirred up as they piled atop each other.

As far as all the negative press around this movie, I find it all almost entirely off base and misdirected. Sarcastic comments like ""Finally, a movie for angry white men who can't get everything they want""... as if there has never been any other films about any psychopaths, maniacs, criminals, or serial killers who also happen to be white men, which have been praised endlessly for decades? Simultaneously we have oodles of people praising shows like MINDHUNTER, with no negative press, while JOKER is getting attacked. They are both about the same thing...psychotic serial killers. That's what this is... an intricate character study about a blossoming psychopath and killer, which also happens to include a multitude of themes that can be aligned with societal obstacles we are currently facing in reality. Yes, you put yourself in the villain's shoes, and you feel fractions of the pain that villain is feeling, but the point is not to GLORIFY or CELEBRATE such darkness, but rather to wallow in it just long enough to feel disrupted then get the hell out of there and go back to your normalcy. JOKER has a lot of heart, a lot of blood pumping through it's veins, and a working brain too - it's actually the most human movie I have seen this year, with the most depth.

I could say a lot more, but I will wrap up instead. I had a smile plastered across my face for 75% of this movie, as I was constantly blown away by either some element of what I was seeing. The other 25% I was scared, sad, or excited - but I was never bored. Not for a second. Every MOMENT was stimulating, and meticulously crafted. This is actually one of the only truly masterful movies I have EVER seen based off of a comic book character - not only is it special in that sense, but it's also boosted Todd Phillips to the league of legendary filmmakers. I'm curious to see if this is a chance one-off, or if Phillips will carry on as a dramatic filmmaker, after going above and beyond with this one. 10 out of 10, in my opinion."
733,"As a watcher never seen DC or other super heroes series before, this movie hooked me. The writer and director are must be genius. Love this movie, love the actor, bless u guys."
735,"Joaquin Phoenix, what can I say more this incredible actor did an extraordinary acting that imo beats heth ledger's performance in the Batman : The dark night,"
736,"A cinematographic perfection. Causing audience to have a heart attack because of it's thrilling and exceptionally made scenes is what makes the whole storyline more interesting. With Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance as Joker, this is the perfect movie to make critics and fans have the same view on a comic book movie."
737,"No spoilers. Like all origin stories it spends way too much time in character development. It also telegraphed it punches. Its is worth seeing just to watch Joaquin Phoenix's performance. It just that the movie did not seem to get the Joker character himself. Their simply was no sense of menace from the Joker, even toward the end of the movie. violence yes, but no menace. Yes I know some people will say the Joker is suppose to use his brain, not his brawn, but if so they did not even show that. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was amazing, but it simply did not convey ""The Joker"" like Heath Ledger, or even Jack Nicholson. IMHO even Jared Leto did a better job. The movie was as indicated above is very American Psycho, in tone, and delivery, including the message, if it was trying to portray a message, which I doubt, because that would have indicated a plot outside of decent into madness. FYI a group of teens left the movie about half way through, it obviously was not what they expected."
738,"I was seriously not interested in that movie after watching some clowns roaming about in the trailer - I'm getting tired of the redundant Purge movies' characters, you know ; and I'm not enjoying the new trend of blurring the lines between good and evil (e.g. Maleficent, 2019). I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when some friends opted for watching it, and I was baffled!

The movie was nothing I had expected it to be. It is actually what a Joker backstory should be like. It is believable, intriguing and down to earth. It is really what you can call an adaptation. Todd Phillips manages to make you feel the darkness in Gotham and how it roves through the city in search of the next victim. The whole Batman universe is thus successfully explained. And Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in the role of the Joker.

This movie is not really for the usual Batman fan in search of fantasy, fight scenes and high-tech accessories, but for the pragmatic moviegoers who can enjoy watching a masterpiece just like others enjoy French cuisine in a 5-starred restaurant - I'm not kidding! Great job!"
739,"Certainly it's difficult to disagree that Joaquin Phoenix gave an excellent performance of a seemingly real person suffering from real issues, but the story was slow-paced and entirely depressing."
740,"Yes, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful job in his portrayal of the Joker. Albeit this Joker is plain and simple just mentally ill. He is generally portrayed in previous genres as a criminal genius mastermind. A person with wit, and masterful comprehension of trickery, and chemicals.

This Joker is no fun, and highly delusional. You may question his intellect as he has to look up simple jokes in a diary he keeps. Yes, for the most part his jokes fall flat. Jack Nicholson' clever portrayal in Batman raised the bar that in my opinion has never quite been reached.

I found myself uncomfortable with this portrayal as you would with someone acting out next to you on a subway. In that respect, Joaquin portrays this bit of brazen craziness to a tee. Craziness for the sake of craziness does not make for entertainment. If a sane person were locked up in a mental institution, you would not be entertained. And that is a bit how this movie felt."
741,Cinematic perfection & flawless acting. One of the best portrayals of the Joker we've seen yet. Joaquin as always pours his heart and soul into the characters and makes them memorable. What made this so good is that I felt I've met people like the characters Phoenix portrayed in real life. And that's what people look for in movies; a reflection of their own life.
742,"From watching Wonder Woman and Aquaman followed by the awful Justice League, I was put off watching anything that came from the DC comics...When this came out I was reluctant to watch this... What pushed me to give it a go was the hype and I have to say, I am glad I took the risk..It paid off

This movie is not like any other comic book movie, it's more of a dark psychological thriller. The acting was first class, great performances by Joaquin Pheonix and Robert DeNiro .... The ending was disturbing and yet comical at the same time"
743,"There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.

Friedrich Nietzsche"
744,"With its very important message, beautiful cinematography, great screenplay & direction, chilling score, and an amazing actor portraying an iconic comic book villain, Joker (2019) succeeds in being one of the best movies of the decade, a masterpiece. This film even surpassed my expectations (and I had a very high expectations to begin with!). Joaquin Phoenix deserves a freaking OSCAR for this bone-chilling performance and kudos to Todd Philips for creating a dark, disturbing film that is effective for it tackles important messages about society, mental health, and the government. An instant classic."
745,"It's fun to see a movie this good on the big screen, but audience reactions, such as laughing at things that aren't intended to be funny can mess with the nuance and atmosphere of this film."
746,"Growing up I've seen all the iterations of the Joker character. From small screen to big screen. All of them are unique in their own way. Don't compare Phoenix to Ledger as the two Jokers are simply two different interpretations of the same concept. This is the story of the Joker from the inside out. There are no punchlines, no gimmicks and no silver lining. There is no hero in this film. This is a study on the concept of the Joker and how he became who he is. This movie is dark, terrifying, introspective and raw. Phoenix simply disappears in his role and you never wonder where he went. Everyone knows that the Joker is insane but never have we ever seen inside his mind like we do here. From top to bottom this film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Phoenix has already won the best actor Oscar. It's just a matter of time before they hand it to him."
747,"Joaquin is the perfect example of what it means for an actor to carry a film. He is simply one of the greatest ever. However, the chronological order, as well as the predictability of this film, makes it far from perfect. Oscar worthy? Well sure, in cinematography as well as in the best actor category. But if it is rewarded with more than that, I'd be surprised."
748,"Joker Is my most favourite comic book movie of 2019. The performances are amazing! I would be surprised if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. The directing and story are great and I really liked the soundtrack. I never got bored watching this film. I can see why some people might not like it but I loved it. This is a win for DC. I hope they do more standalone films like this. This film transcends the genre and doesn't feel like a comic book movie. For some people that might be an issue but for me it works. I would highly recommend this film.

9.5/10"
750,This was badly overhyped on all levels. Joaquin Phoenix whom I usually enjoy did not portray the man who became the Joker very well. Robert De Niro whom I normally love as well was just a twisted version of the late Johnny Carson. Worst of all was the directing job of Todd Phillips. He should not have taken on this movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME
751,Joachim Phoenix is the best. how can someone act so good. just speechless.
753,"I thought I was going to find this movie to be a bit too weird, but I actually liked it. It was very intriguing throughout, even though it was a dark movie. I like how the how the character of the joker is portrayed, although I found the dancing to be a bit weird. One downside of the movie and I'll try not to spoil the movie as much as I can, but how is it possible that anyone can bring a gun into a TV studio? Other than that, this is a great drama movie and probably up there with the best. I see some users giving this a low rating; I assume they were expecting this to be action-packed or they can't handle the dark tone of the movie."
754,"The only emotion I was able to understand after watching this film for the first time was disturbed. It invoked one of the longest and thought-provoking conversations I've had after watching a film. One of the biggest being its portrayal of mental illness, which may have been the most realistic I've seen, and the graphic violence. Only after watching it a second time did I realize how little violence there is in the film. The way Todd Phillips was able to make the viewer feel so strongly about the protagonist's journey throughout is a testament to him, Joaquin Phoenix and anyone involved in the film, especially the way the cinematographer used colors. It balanced an original story and comic book origin story flawlessly and after the second viewing, was able to look past it's 'not so' graphic nature and understand everything Arthur was going through and was somehow able to empathize and disagree with a character at the same time as they slipped into madness. This may be one of the most important works of mainstream art in our time."
755,"I love this movie. It so dark and brutal, in a great way. Dont watch this movie, if dont like too mutch blood. I really hope Warner Bros. Will make the future Gotham movies like this."
756,"Joker is a dark, humour, bizarre and disturbing journey of Arthur fleck. Everyscene was like a filament in a bulb. Joaquin Phoenix - ur a monster💙 that laugh is as contagious as anything can get!

Don't know about the oscars, but it was once in the lifetime performance by Joaquin Phoenix....and would remain in my heart for years & in my brain for days to come,,,may be.....The best portrayal of a psycho character that I have seen!"
757,"It's a really good film that conveys a relevant message. But it plays fast and loose with ""show don't tell"" while bridging the gap between one part of the story and the next. You might find yourself asking ""wait... how did things blow out of proportion so quickly?"" in regards to the world around Joker, and not really finding much of an answer beyond a couple of off-hand explanations."
758,"A stunning performance by JP. I was totally transfixed. A study of all those dark depressing things we would rather not contemplate, but should not turn our backs on; this is life."
759,"I had high expectations for this film, but it completely destroyed them. This film is about The Joker, but in my opinion more than anything, it's about mental illness. It's about people who feel alone and are angry at the world. The movie shows how Arthur Fleck turns into The Joker, and it's a stunning watch, filled with incredible acting, directing, writing, music, and cinematography. A truly stunning work of art that I won't forget for a long time."
761,"Jaquin Phoenix is amazing as always and New York looks pretty good, but everything else....

The plot is very contrived and pretty much a mess. Aiming more for shock value than smart, interesting or even a coherent story. It's another bad depiction of mental illness, with nothing interesting to say. If you weren't paying attention, don't worry. You'll get a recap of the whole movie at the end by Jaquin Phoenix.

This movie is just a copy and an imitation of better movies mashed together and slapped with the ""Joker"" name and ""Warner Brothers"" logo. For people who have not seen ""Taxi Driver"", ""The King of Comedy"" and other better movies.

Its called ""Joker"" just because if it wasn't nobody would see/like this and nobody would care. The script was probably done before deciding that this is a ""Joker"" movie. By only changing the name and the makeup you could call it anythin. You could call it ""Chaplin"" or ""Mr. Bean"" or ""Dracula"" or whoever because it doesn't matter....

Todd Philips probably wanted to remake ""Taxi Driver"" but Warner Brothers only gave mone for a ""DC"" movie so.....

(This sentence was censored by your friendly neighborhood IMDb) Are you happy now?

Not worth a watch"
762,"While part of me is annoyed that a gritty, socially-concerned drama like this only made over a billion dollars because of its superhero connections (seriously, without the Batman connection, I doubt at least 3/4 of the audience would have bothered to show up), I was still impressed with JOKER. It's stylish and atmospheric, both bleakly comedic and heartbreaking. Joaquin Phoenix does outstanding work representing his character's plummet into bitterness and insanity-- I cannot wait to watch the movie again, just to catch more nuances in his performance."
763,"This is now the third time that I saw this movie. The first was in the theater. I then watched it with Jaime when we were dating. We've now given it another rewatch while on vacation. It was one that is on our Internet Movie Database Top 100 movies. We both liked it quite a bit and it deserved another watch for sure.

For this, we follow Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix). He's a man who needs help. He has mental illness and the state doesn't seem to care about him. The people at his job treat him poorly. His mother isn't all that nice to him. She also clings to the delusion that Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) will help them. I should point out that her name is Penny (Frances Conroy). Arthur turns to comedy, but he doesn't fully understand it. He also looks up to Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) who has a local, nightly talk show.

Arthur also works as a clown. One day, he is tired of being pushed around and kills some guys. This creates a movement. I don't think he meant to, but it happens. Arthur also goes on a bit of self-discovery and revenge.

Now I'm guessing most everyone saw this movie. I loved it the first time in the theater and the more that I've seen, it holds up. The performance from Phoenix as Arthur is amazing. It is also heartbreaking. Jaime and I both agreed that what he is doing is wrong, but we can see how it happens. He just wants someone to listen and help him. No one does though. He is surrounding by good acting as well.

I wanted to keep with this idea of no one helping Arthur. We get a great look at the Reagan era politics that cut funding that would help people like Arthur. He no longer has someone to check in on him. He also can longer get his medications. It also takes place at a time where New York was rougher. It is interesting that this is setting up as a Batman film while also being grounded in its fictional story. I think that allows this to transcend what it is doing.

There's not a lot more I have to say. This is an excellent made movie. From making it feel like the era it is set to the beautiful cinematography. Phoenix's performance and the lengths he went to prepare for the role. The soundtrack also adds another layer as well.

My Rating: 10 out of 10."
764,This was the best movie of 2019 a TRUE must watch so much better than Endgame even better than the dark knight trilogy best movie of 2019!!!!
765,"I was getting sick off going to the cinema these days with crappy sequels, soulless action flick and just the same old films that keeps ruining Hollywood, but then I watched Joker and I have to say that the if people keeps making movies like this I have no doubt that the film industry is saved. This is an absolute masterpiece that just sucks you ind and never lets go. Its brutal, its terrifying, its so tragic that you really feel for Arthur Flex and his alter ego the Joker to the point that you almost forgets that he actually is a psychopathic killer. Jacqueline Phoenix gives the performance of his life, the laughter, the smile and his creepy and sympathetic voice sells the character completely 100 pro cent. I love this movie, is the best movie I have seen in a decade, and I don't think that will change any time soon."
766,"As a DC comic fanboy, it completely blew me away. Words alone couldn't describe how beautiful this movie is. Amazing, Fabulous, Smashing, terrifying, Masterpiece, every second.

Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie. Everything about this Movie is masterful in every single way! Just as Christopher Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight Trilogy, #Joker is unlike anything we've ever seen before.

I was pretty sure no one ever could match Heath ledger's Joker. But I was wrong, This might be the best DC film ever made. Joaquin pheonix breathtaking performance and Todd Phillips' clever directing did the impossible. Heath ledger will be happy watching this movie from heaven.

The film offers a dark look of 1980's Gotham City, as we never have seen before in comics. It brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.

This movie kind of mirrors how I feel on a day to day basis. I would say its way better than the Endgame and The Dark Knight, but that's for me 😉 Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.

Experience it... And the ending of the film just blows your brain away. A sure nomination for this year's Oscars."
767,"Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, is the origin story of the infamous Batman arch nemesis , taking place in Gotham in the 80s. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a man deep into mental health issues. He suffers from uncontrollable bouts of laughter, has deep-rooted self-confidence issues and is currently living in a city just on the brink of disaster. Not helping the matters is his situation as a life-in caretaker for his demented mother, and his dead-end job as a clown-for-hire. And then he gets that little push, to quote another Batman movie.

What Joker is, beneath all the layers, is a never-ending spiral into insanity, madness and ruin. Whenever you think that there's a ray of hope, of sunshine, the movie pulls the rug underneath your feet. Whenever you start to feel any sympathy for Arthur, he does something heinous or ups the ante. Whenever you think you have found someone to root for in this film, they reveal an ugly side to their persona.

And yet the movie has levity to it. As befitting the character. It's a horrible, depressing film, but it does get a chuckle out of you. Which makes everything that follows even more depressing. Which is the Joker, in a nutshell.

Furthermore, it's absolutely gorgeously filmed, the dialogues are great, the characters have real bite to them, the 80s Gotham is fantastically realized and it's just topnotch film making all around.

If I had to nitpick, I would say that the film didn't necessarily need the inclusion of Bruce Wayne into it. It doesn't ruin the narrative, but it also felt just a bit tacked on, truth be told. Still, a minor gripe at best.

Very good film. Nolan's The Dark Knight is still a better Batman film, as far as I'm concerned, but this film is a contender."
768,"In short, this is a decent drama about mental illness that, for some unfathomable reason, plays with the DC universe and the Joker character, although it shouldn't have. This Joker has little to nothing to do with all the previous incarnations we've seen so far, and the whole story kind of falls to pieces once you look away from the main character and consider the bigger picture.

Also, as a side note: please stop it with the continuous (although more often than not unwarranted) reboots of entire universes/franchises and ""re-geneses"" of characters... I can understand the need to remarket a ""product"" to make it appealing again to new audiences, tastes and fads, and make more money out of it, but this is becoming ridiculous... (3 totally different Jokers in 10 years...)

6.5/7 out of 10 (as a drama/crime story revolving around mental illness)"
769,"8/10 - this slow-build of a drama features excellent performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Zazie Beetz, although I'm not sure I would want to see it again"
770,"When I saw the first trailer it was very clear the Hangover director Todd Phillips was not intending to direct a traditional origin story to a comic book character. While I have heard this movie was controversial for its shameless copying of Martin Scorsese's early films like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy (both films I have unfortunately not seen so I have no context on), cynical nature, and dangerous messaging it might send to the wrong person, I still found it to be fascinating and compelling to watch while still being disturbed by it. This is a very dark, and cynical film Todd Philips has made. It felt very far removed from the fantastical elements of the Batman mythology even compared to Christopher Nolan's grounded Dark Knight trilogy.

Joaquin Phoenix carries the movie even when the film seems itself is dragging on for no reason. While Heath Ledger will still be my favourite incarnation of the Joker, Phoenix gives a performance that is more layered and complex. Starting as Arthur Fleck struggling to live in a poor 1970's Gotham, Phoenix makes his character feel human but also broken in the way he moves and how he quietly speaks. From his bone-skinny physique to the uncontrolled laughter as part of his mental condition, you can feel that Arthur is suffering inside but is trying to hide it to look normal and to fit in. When a moment comes that gains Arthur some attention as a mysterious vigilante dressed as a clown, the boost in ego and attention gives him purpose in his meaningless existence. There Phoenix embraces the darker nature of this character as his sanity melts away and he begin to see his reality as some twisted joke that has tormented him. He strikes a good balance of making him terrifying and disturbing while still showing a sense of sadness in him he carries.

What also surprised me was the quality of the score and cinematography. Despite Joker being a dark and disturbing film, Lawrence Sher makes every shot stunning and beautiful with the way it puts Arthur at centre of the frame. Hildur Guðnadóttir's score uses accordions to reflect how Arthur's views of comedy and tragedy intertwine before it going deep and twisted.

The movie's tackling of social politics is both its strength and weakness. The movie does feel very socially relevant with today's politics on how the Wayne family stand in to reflect the Trump administration. And Arthur's plight makes for an interesting case of how the mentally-ill are not provided with proper care needed and are discarded without thinking of what consequences could be. Unfortunately Phillips as the film's director and co-writer does not make it subtle when it comes to how the social commentary is delivered on screen. A lot of dialogue felt very blunt and forced in how the film was trying to say its messaging.

As the movie goes on through most of its runtime, it did feel like it was dragging on without anything that is pivotal happening. There were many moments where I as wondering if some scenes were really necessary for the purpose of the plot or story. But once it reaches its climatic third act as Arthur finishes his transformation into the Joker, Phoenix goes all out with his performance in one scene that will for sure become on of the most talked-about scenes this year.

This movie felt very much it reflected on the director Todd Philips's comment about pc culture is killing comedy. While I don't agree with his pathetic comment, I can see how his tastes and dark sense of humor is maybe the best way to make a movie like this especially with exploring the bleak backstory of DC's most iconic villain. Joker may not be the movie everyone enjoys but it is at least fascinating to watch for the Joaquin Phoenix alone."
771,"A modern Neo-noir crime drama which begs the philosophical question of acceptance in the society and dares to ask hard question on the role society plays in the making of a criminal. Beautifully acted, perfectly directed, magnificently shot, the movie transcends the genre film making with a hint scorseseism violence and story telling. The performance of joaquin phoenix is beyond imagination, the actor outdid himself."
772,"When I went to the theatre to see this movie, I was expecting an ordinary movie about a DC villian. But what I saw was way, way more than that. Not only does it show Joker's origin but also shows how society treats people who are a bit different from them. Todd Phillips did an amazing job presenting the little details that show Aurther Fleck's degrading mentality. And the way the music and camera shots emphasises that idea is nothing short of remarkable. Joaquin Phoenix delivered an oscar-winning performance, which made the movie something I will remember for the rest of my life."
773,"I have to admit that I had a certain fear to this film. The first thing I'm a big DC fan, the Joker is my favorite DC villain, and to make a movie about him without Batman, somehow illogical and unimaginable. Second, the director is Todd Phillips who has now done only comedies (admittedly good and really good) such as Hangover, Due Date and Road Trip. I knew that Joaquin will be great as he has already proven and rewarded an actor with several great roles, but history has taught me that it's no guarantee because the last Joker was catastrophic and the actor is also a great actor (Jared Leto has an Oscar).

I was so wrong.

The film is perfect, crafty and brutal. Most of all it tells me that even after three days of looking at it, I still think about him, about acting, about scenes, about music, about a possible message. As expected, Joaquin was singled out by the big screen overall. Each scene is his own, he ate the part and ordered the desert afterwards. He brutally gave himself into it, physically and mentally. Honestly, it will be a bigger surprise if he doesn't win an Oscar, but it doesn't even matter given the award history. He showed so many emotions and layers of one fictional character on a larger level, leaning to the floor! Any comparisons to Ledger are unnecessary, they both did the job to the highest possible level, each with their own version that fits the film. Both are perfect. I did mind the two minor things in the movie, however they turned it around to fit the story so I have no qualms. I really like that this can't be called some kind of superhero movie that we've been bombarded with for years, it's a pure psychological drama. It reminded me a lot of the tone and atmosphere of Taxi Driver, even in some scenes one can see the impact and similarities in Martin Scorsese's film. It was as if it was shot in the 1970s which was Hollywood's prime golden age.

Honestly, the reactions of film critics, ranging from disappointment to excellent, were not clear to me. In the last few years, you may have 5 films for which you will become a cult classic in the future. The Joker is definitely one of them.

Purely subjective and well deserved ten!"
774,One of the best performance i ever saw! The Greatest JoKer of all time. Well done Joaquin well done.
775,"Joker is a very unconventional take on a comic book. An origin story combined with deep message about mental illness and class warfare. This movie beautifully shows the harsh and brutal world that is many people's reality. it's a dark character study about a mentally disturbed individual who is frustrated with the world and has been pushed to the the point where he can't take it any longer. The movie doesn't condones the violence but encourages people to help those in need instead of looking down on them and leaving them feeling like there's nothing left to lose to the point that they hurt themselves or others. Joaquin Phoenix is very committed to his role, he really gets into the skin of his character. He accurately portrayed a person struggling with mental health.

The film has a terrific ominous look, and Gotham felt very authentic as a depressing, gritty and bleak city, thanks to the wonderful production design and a beautiful cinematography, accompanied by Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting score, that takes life of its own, shaking you to your core and inflicting you deep inside the feelings of Arthur Fleck.

On the whole, Joker, technically excels and shows just how awful society can be and how bad the world is to the less fortunate."
776,"This film is raw, dark, and honest. You never quite feel empathy for Arthur, but you do sometimes find a bit of sympathy for him never crossing the line into being ok with him. From the very first 1 minute he is awkward, creepy and clearly on edge. You're always uncomfortable.

The build up is fantastic, and each part of the story was a major factor in the finale.

EPIC"
777,"Joker: Gotham City is a grim place to live in, refuse collectors on strike, social services being cut back, widespread violent crime, a sharp divide between the rich and the poor. The Joker works as a clown at an agency where the clowns have to punch in on a time clock. He gets the worst gigs, beaten up by kids when he's advertising a closing down sale. Loses his psychiatrist and medication due to the cutbacks. He has to look after his crazed invalid mother who writes to billionaire Thomas Wayne begging for help as she worked for him decades ago. Then he loses his job. All of this pushes him to breaking point.



We have a killer clown pursuing his prey along subway trains and platforms. Long corridors in hospitals, apartment buildings, steep sets of steps. A city on the brink of class war. When three of his employees are slain by the Joker Wayne decides to run for mayor, on a 1% platform, calling the poor clowns. He gets his answer as mobs riot while wearing clown masks. They see the Joker as a hero. Some scenes of savage violence as the Jokers break from reality continues and his new villain persona emerges. Great scenes of hordes of clowns travelling by subway trains to protests and riots. Very much an adult version of the Joker with an outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the title role. Robert De Niro plays Murray Franklin a talk show host originally adored by the Joker. We get to meet Alfred and the young Bruce Wayne but this is the Joker's story. Writer, director and producer Todd Phillips delivers a dark origin tale which likely puts himself and Phoenix in the running for Oscars. 9/10."
779,"The kind of movie that's somehow over-rated by some of its most hardcore fans and over-hated by some of its biggest detractors at the same time.

The former side overlooks how blunt and on the nose it can be, but the latter side seems to overlook how great aspects like Phoenix and the music are.

Won't spew paragraphs for this; Joker got discussed to death back in 2019, but yeah... this got put on at a house I was at, I didn't think I'd watch the whole thing, but it held up on a rewatch. There's really good things here and I think it's paced well and is a consistently engaging watch, but yeah... some clunky aspects, and I've never been a big fan of that final scene either."
780,I didn't like or dislike the storyline. I was totally indifferent and noticed about halfway through I was ready for another Prime Russian or Hasidic movie or series. Netflix and Prime are weaning me from American fare. Now that I can stay up with the CC I am an appreciator (is that a word) of foreign film. I watched the third House of Flowers before this (A Mexican series) and it was ten times better than Joker. I don't care if Joker made a trillion dollars. It was typical American fare - brooding and in general not entertaining. I went to sleep about a half hour before the end of the movie and don't know how it ended.
781,No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.
782,"After watching this I fail to see how or why this film was so controversial. In fact, it helps to stop the glorification of violence. But as for the film itself, it was produced and shot masterfully. The ending was a bit underwhelming but worked well."
783,"The acting is insane! phoenix is brilliant,the oscar is 100%!i really did not expect the movie so genius! great movies didn't need CGI to storm the box office!!"
784,"The story did bring up awareness of mental illness. Acting of Phoenix is phenomenal. Look at the poster first impression is a horror, and indeed it's a horror deep down of human dark side with tragic story behind. Mix of all the elements did have chance to win Oscar."
785,"And I don't use that label lightly. I've rated a couple hundred movies on IMDB and very few have I rated this high. Maybe two? Literally my only complaint is that it didn't go on longer. I watched it with my family (18 to 52) and ""more please"" was the strong sentiment. Just beautifully scripted, acted, directed, and filmed. Not a single misstep as a film. Bravo! (Not a movie for kids under 14)"
786,"Amazing, Fabulous, Smashing, Masterpiece, every second of this deserve a big clap Tod Phillips made it like every joker fan wanted, if Joaquin doesn't get Oscar then we must check the last oscar winings!"
787,"Just finished watching #Joker and got to say Joaquin Phoenix's acting was absolutely brilliant I'd be very surprised if he doesn't get an oscar! Film maybe slow for some it's not your typical comic book movie but the acting, the feeling and emotionally bold storytelling is realistic yet dark. 👌"
789,"No, this is not the joker as you have seen him these past decades, it is what made him who he is - and at times, not a pleasant picture.

It has been sometime for films to finance and back character studies into ""why"". In the 70s, there were plenty of them, now its 2019, and here is one. It is Joaquin Phoenix's performance from frame one to the end. It's dark, you'll laugh, you'll possibly be shocked - but he keeps you engaged in his portrayal of the character, which in films like this, is of the utmost importance. It does take one back to that decade - all of it's color and darkness. And there is no need for an overkill in special effects and imagery. It's dreary, just like his life. But he becomes the epitome of what many have been holding back for years - and so, what will become.

I really appreciate this film because of that, as it does go back to a time before we got caught up in so much, we forget about the character itself, so know this is a character study of what we already know how it will turn out. So, why did I give the film an 8 instead of a 10? Well..I am a fan of the deep character development of ..Travis Bickle and...Randle McMurphy...and..Rupert Pupkin and for me there was a tad bit too much reference of them than an homage should be - but again, Joaquin Phoenix gives the best character performance for me since Gladiator and for a DC Comic Book character, one of the best without the 3 decades of cinematic bells and whistles ."
791,"That is one of the most aimless, predictable and shallow films I've seen. The only thing that made any sense was that it was somehow connected to the Batman universe. Joaquin's ability to portray a psychopath, although pointless, was ultimately decimated by the fact this was a Batman film. I can't really take it seriously because of that. There is no real social drama, it has no message and is full of fallacies. It doesn't raise any awareness. Dialogs when present were pathetic. All in all the Joker is neither a real film based on true events nor a fiction. It tries really hard to do both and it fails spectacularly."
792,"The Joker is back and he's great. A great beginning with hopefully more to come. Focusing on acting more than action, it's an enjoyable if not disturbing film and any fan of DC should love this film. It inevitably leaves you wanting more and I look forward to seeing him again. Hahahahaha hahahaha hahahaha haha."
793,"Just saw the #Joker last night in Bahrain and it sent chills down my spine . I think this is a one of a kind movie , something that should be experienced by all movie lovers . A slow burn into reality which is far more haunting than fiction.It is not a Superhero movie nope .... it is a super villain movie .An honest reflection of how we are all responsible in creating monsters .Simply a masterpiece . Oscars ... yes for sure."
794,"Journey trough modern world's cruelty and depression... Using character of Joker like an example of troubled,mistreated ,abused and ignored by society person,this film makes a very powerful statement,by bringing on the surface all the disgusting and disturbing sides of the world in which we all have to survive...Not for everybody...but for majority-life is tough and complicated...Brilliant performance ...Very sad movie...Makes you think and feel.Well done."
795,"This is such an important film. Not just for an amazing look into the depths of a character we know little about but also for awareness of how we act around others and mental illness. A great film; dark, twisted and a story that's beautifully told and shot. An abolute masterpiece of modern cinema."
796,"The way this film portrays mental illness and one's decline into it with a BRILLIANTLY stunning performance from Joaquin Phoenix, directing and writing that makes you shocked and uncomfortable (in a surprisingly good way) every step of the way, all of it is just too good. This is one of the top movies of 2019 hands down. A sequel would come off as an insult to this film."
797,"Here's a Better Late than Never review of ""Joker"" (R - 2019 - Blu)

Genre: Drama/ComicDC My Score: 9.1

Cast=10 Acting=10 Plot=9 Ending=10 Story=8 Interest=9 Script=10 Filming=9 Comic=7 Dark=9

A mentally troubled stand-up comedian embarks on a downward spiral that leads to the creation of an iconic villain.

""The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't."" This movie not only made me rethink the Joker character, but reevaluate the other actors who played the character going all the way back to Caesar Romero. Joaquin Phoenix did such an amazing job...he deserved that Oscar for sure. What got me was the musical score, though...this movie grips you and doesn't let go."
798,"The beginning is SO slow. I normally love movies that start off with some non-action parts because I like getting to know the characters, however this movie was almost too slow in the beginning.

I also dislike how dumb they make Arthur to be. Heath Ledgers joker was a master schemer, clever and not stupid by any means. Arthur in Joker is just an insecure slow guy who can't even spell. His killings are just like a guy that snaps and gets away with it for a bit. There's nothing clever or original.

The one and only original scene that I wish the whole movie was like more was the midget / scissor scene. I liked the dark humor and the originality in this scene. You didn't know what he was going to do next. The rest of the movie you already know what's going to happen.

He also laughs way, way too much. By the time the movie was halfway over I was praying he wouldn't go into a laughing fit anymore. The movie started to end well, and then they show an unnecessary extra scene with a closeup shot of Arthur laughing again.

I love Joaquin Phoenix but I didn't like how dim they made him. I mean killings happen all the time in Gotham and there was nothing so inspirational about his first killings that would've made the whole city praise and worship him. He was just a dumb, damaged guy that got lucky. This movie was just an all around feel-bad film."
799,"I really liked the way heath ledger portrayed joker in dark knight. Funny, cunning, evil. If he was living today, he would have aced this movie. But surprisingly, Joaquin does it even better. He is rarely funny but very alone and pathetic. His condition becomes worse and worse until he breaks out, wreaking havoc to Gotham. The story flows smoothly through Arthur's life, how the situation around influences him to become the joker. The supporting characters including Robert de Niro have done an excellent job but nobody can beat Joaquin. He was at a completely different level!! A pure masterclass of cinema. If you are a fan of joker, don't miss this one! Another Oscar worthy performance from Joaquin. If he gets it, it ll be second time for the same role."
800,"Are we loving ""Joker"" because of the actual plot and screenplay or we just can't have enough of Joaquin Phoenix's talent?

This movie has a clear message and Joaquin Phoenix is undoubtedly phenomenal.

However, the actual movie is kind of messy and the only thing that saved it was the acting."
801,"Joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of Fight Club or the Scorsese films it lifts from. It's interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and groundbreaking are being used for this, and that is the one joke that this movie successfully pulls off. It's just a whole lot of self-seriousness and posturing and is essentially hollow. It pretends to say a lot but ends up saying very little or nothing at all, not about the character nor about the society he's part of.

It is also 'Joker' only in name and has very little to do with the super-villain. I'm all for a different interpretation and even an origin story for the joker but this movie fails to recognise or capture his spirit. Even 'Proto-Joker' doesn't quite do it justice, and I can think of a dozen more suitable titles e.g. Arthur, The Untalented Mr. Fleck, Smoker, Poser etc. Infact he's more akin to a less dangerous but also mentally unstable villain like Ratcatcher or Calendar Man though just with a clown theme, and is not even close to embodying the joker's extreme form of nihilism. It's not that it has to be a comic-book accurate portrayal, that would be irrelevant if it was genuinely a good movie. But far from being a masterpiece , it doesn't quite manage even that. It fails not just as an inaccurate portrayal of the Joker's spirit or essence, but also as a film about a person going over the edge.

The weakest aspect of the movie for me is the poor to average direction. The movie lacks any of the subtlety and nuance that I was hoping for and what unfolds is not as much character development as it is things happening to Arthur. A good example of the poor writing and direction is the very Trump-like and one-dimensional Thomas Wayne character. This first became obvious during a scene in which some people happened to know the entire lyrics to a clown song. In a movie that otherwise tries very hard to be realistic that felt very unnecessary and took me out of the experience and it felt very contrived and predictable after that. It takes too many obvious liberties and plot conveniences to move the story forward in an unnatural and unrefined way, and ultimately felt like they tried to disguise the poor writing and direction with a dark and gritty atmosphere instead of those elements complementing each other.

The only reason to watch this movie is Phoenix's performance, which while not groundbreaking is good enough to earn an awards nomination or two. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Heath Ledger's portrayal but they were two very different roles and characters. Ledger made his joker seem effortless while one can really see the strain and work Phoenix puts in. To put it simply, Ledger made it seem natural and didn't look like he was acting while with Phoenix you really know that he is, even to the extent that it may seem like overacting at times. Perhaps owing to the more physical nature of this version of whoever this character is supposed to be, that's not necessarily a criticism.

Overall an average film at best that pretends to be a lot more. I don't see this one ageing well or being remembered decades later the way Fight Club or the Scorsese movies it's ""inspired"" by, or CBM's like Dark Knight or Logan or even Tim Burton's Batman, are remembered today."
802,This is one of the best movies i have ever watched. all the critics are either idiot or bought.
803,"Just got back from seeing it 4 hours ago and it was as great as I thought it was gonna be, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fantastic (everyone else is great too but Joaquin commands the entire thing), the score and soundtrack were fantastic, the opening credits fit perfectly with the theme, and even the cinematography is great (this was a grimier, dirtier, and uglier Gotham City than what we're used to). it can easily pass as a scorsese flick since his fingerprints were left after leaving the producer's chair. I'm torn between which joker I like best between ledger and Phoenix, but I know that heath ledger would be very proud of Joaquin for pulling it off, give him ALL the oscars I say, he's earned them. but anyway, I recommend this to scorsese fans and joker fans alike. I definitely wanna see it again, maybe even buy the blu-ray. on a side note, for it being a slow burn, it's actually a slow burn done right like The Godfather"
804,"I truly enjoyed the emotional experience of the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix performed the role in a way that made me forget everything else and hope the movie never ends. The supporting cast did an amazing job, Joaquin overshadowed everything else with his performance. I didn't think about Heath Ledger once throughout the entire movie. Bravo to the entire team behind this movie!"
805,"I haven't sat through the entire credits in stunned silence since ''let the right one in"" baring no resemblance to this movie whatsoever I was left completely speechless as to what I'd just witnessed. The term masterpiece is thrown around alot these days but Jaquin's nailed on performance of one of society's forgotton tormented souls that inevitabley arcs into the fragile but brutal criminal psychopath we know as the joker is understatedley 'perfect' to a level where the viewer is left to almost encourage Aurthur's inevitable wrong doings and sucker you into morally second guessing yourself with 'is he actually doing wrong?' I could go on but there are many other reviews for you to read that will say everything I would have said about the cinematography, music, sound,direction,set pieces, un-nerving tension, the violence, the twists and every other reason we love movies which Joker pulls off so so well. If you've not already booked to see it just drop what your doing and book. Just dont expect a superhero movie."
806,"This movie seems more of the art genre than antiheroes.

It was a surprise to realize the type of production of this film, everything is very artistic, even the story unfolds slowly but allows the viewer to interpret certain things. The story is deep, it talks about mental disorders and their origins, it also talks about today's society and how we despise certain people, and how others are admired, each scene has a purpose, the main character has a wide development. There are very shocking and raw scenes, the justification for the main character is valid and credible. The performances are impressive, on another level, the music is spectacular, the entire production is of quality and reflects the dark reality of the character.

I think the only point against it is that in the second act the pace slows down a bit, but everything else works very well and reflects the great execution of this amazing idea of this movie."
809,"Incredible outstanding chapeau bas total respect to the actor , oscar for sure if no so RIP hollywood ..... One of the best film this year , NO!!! I mean one of the best film ever ..... I hope i can go by time and watch it again and agian and again....."
810,This is not a movie for everybody but go to wathched is the best of the year and i hope that will be nominaded to a oscars
811,"I guess all the kids who hail this as a masterpiece have never seen Taxi Driver. There are way better dark brooding psychological descent into madness because society sucks movies out there. After about 20 minutes I lost interest in this movie, because by that time everything it has say was already said and done. Vapid storytelling for people who've never seen a world without facebook and google. Joaquin's performance is the only redeeming quality. Still, his performance in The Master (2012) was better, ofcourse amplified by the late master himself, Philip Seymour Hoffman.

Will not rewatch The Joker ever again. Once was more than enough. I might rewatch Taxi Driver again soon, to wash this overhyped nonsense out of my mind."
812,"I was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype. I actually didn't enjoy watching this movie. there was no message, it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying. I don't see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone. I'm just stunned that this has a 9/10 rating right now, how the hell?"
813,"Marvel Studio's productions are generally liked by most people. They've got their ups and downs, but for the most part they're all really solid, fun movies to watch. With the exception of a few movies, none of them really resonate emotionally with me. Some of them have their moments that do nearly bring a tear to your eye, but apart from some deaths they really never have much in terms of moving me emotionally.

Nolan's Batman series and Logan are really the only superhero movies that I can think of that really made me feel something while watching them. Joker is now another one that I can add to that list. Not all the emotions were describable, but this movie definitely effected me.

Most of the reason it got to me is Joaquin Phoenix's performance. Take that away from this movie and replace it with an okay performance, and it'd be just an alright movie. The plot isn't the strong point of the movie. The strength of this movie is the titular character. His performance mixed with the powerful score and beautiful cinematography are what elevate this movie. The plot on it's own is alright, nothing too complex. Lack of complexity is what makes this work. It's a simple story about a man driven to become Joker and not much more.

What works best about this movie is that how grounded it feels compared to most other comic book movies. Strip the DC license from it, remove Gotham, Joker, the Wayne family and replace them with just normal non-licensed characters, it still works. This could be a movie about Joe Smith living in Detroit with the same stuff that happens in the movie and it'd still be extremely compelling. What brings it a level higher is the fact that it is about DC characters and that they even let them take a risk and do this movie.

We've had dark super-hero movies like Nolan's Batman, and we've had violent ones like Logan and Deadpool, but nothing has felt quite as grounded as this. As ""realistic"" as Nolan's Batman movies were, they were still stuck in the fantastical comic world. That's not a bad thing, but they just don't feel quite as real as Joker does.

Part of me really wants to see Joaquin appear again and go head-to-head with some version Batman, but part of me doesn't. At the end when he fully adapts the Joker persona I was left wanting to see this fully converted man battle it out with Batman, but also with everything else happening it really works beautifully as a one-off story. This movie shows that we don't need to have every property in a cinematic universe. It's amazing that Marvel worked out and we do have a 25+ movie cinematic universe, but not every property has to go that route. We could use a one-off story here and there, no need for sequels or adjacent movies where they all team up.

Honestly would be kind of weird to see Phoenix's Joker have a scheme similar to the one Ledger's had in TDK, but I would also like to see what kind of Director Todd Phillips would do as a follow up. How he would do his own Batman v Joker movie set in the realistic world he created for this movie.

Whether they decide to make a sequel or never do another one, I think I'll be happy either way."
814,"Ad Astra 2hrs of total boredom,Joker grips you from the first minute to the last. Hope this gets the recognition it deserves."
815,"This movie will show you how serious and uncomprehensible a mental state like this is.
Joker didn't become like this just for no reason, the oppression, pressure, the environment that shaped him into this is all there. Making him not the only one to blame, or to call EVIL, the movie shows you perfectly how society can be dirty, unjust, inhuman, evil in the same way.
You will feel for Joker, you will pity him, you will despise him, you will like him, you will fear him, these all feeligns will be there in you, the only thing that will be questionable is your judgement... you won't be able to judge him, only yourself and the system you live in.
There is no hero here, it's a trip of torment where the pleasure comes in the form of understanding all the mess behind a twisted, deformed mind, a mind that by becoming a villain finally finds its peace, by becoming complete. There won't be a hero and a villain in the end, it will be a villain against other villain(s).




This is an important and a must-see motion picture. This will be the best movie you will see today amongst all that BS Hollywood/America selfglorifying mess! We live in a messy, imperfect, arrogant system and you better face it. This production will make anyone, even those who point their fingers on others to look in themselves and get some perspective of their own reality."
816,"Jokers character has been developed before in TV & film, Nicholson doing the good sci fi version in 80s. Yet THIS redo is utterly original in both drama, Gotham, & creating the Joker. Viewer don't see overnight sci fincreep but a very human transformation of a sweet lost soul pushed into insanity as he loses the few precious possessions due to others lies & apathy.

Joaquin def deserved an Oscar for his incredible performance. Nothing is sugar coated nor repeated. Film grips one from start & grows more compelling. The ugly side of humanity is showcased & how society can crumble due to selfishness;, when ""haves"" got everything & "" havenots"" are too many w/ nothing to lose. Great score & use of iconic songs in film."
817,"In the dark and crime ridden streets of Gotham, Batman may be fighting for justice, but the Joker is waging his own war. The way he sees it, the Joker considers himself the hero of his story; a world that is naturally prone to violence and chaos and he's the only one who finds the joke of it. Also unlike Batman who dresses in black to use the darkness to his advantage, the Joker is bright and colorful to not only be seen, but to be the star of his crime show. This is what makes the dynamic of these two the ultimate hero versus villain setup.

Most people know Batman's story of his parents slain which makes him want to stop others from having the same tragic events, but what about the Joker? When you really think about it, the movies have not tackled the backstory of the clown prince of crime. Batman and The Dark Knight certainly gives you an idea of their psychopathic characters, but not their roots. The closest we got was The Killing Joke graphic novel, which is still a critically phrased story. With Joker, we now see if film can deliver a worthy background.

In the early eighties in Gotham, a lonely man Arthur Fleck (played by Joaquin Phoenix) is trying his hardest to ""bring joy and laughter to the people of Gotham"" by working as a clown for hire and aspires to be a stand up comedian. He also suffers a neurological condition that causes him to laugh at random moments. Though he's told to ""put on a happy face"" by his mother Penny (played by Frances Conroy), the city's high crime and decay from graffiti and rats only make things worse for him. In fact, he finds that due to budget cuts, he won't be able to get any more medication to treat his problems.

While dressed as a clown, he gets into an incident where three people that work for Thomas Wayne get killed, several people in Gotham see him as a symbol to go after the wealthy establishment. Since nobody knows it was Arthur, he carries on with his standup. A botched performance ends up on the TV show of Murray Franklin (played by Robert De Niro), who invites the latter to explain. As the city seems to be hitting a boiling point of anger, combined with more problems for Arthur, he starts to realize just what kind of clown he is.

Joker is inspired by a lot of Martin Scorsese movies like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. While I don't know if it reaches the same heights, I still enjoyed Joker a lot...or as much as you can get out of this kind of story. The first half of the movie really stands on it's own about a guy whose already broken and is getting worse by a world that doesn't seem to be listening. Despite some reports, I don't think were supposed to sympathize with this guy, even though we do see everything that happens to him, and can imagine why a guy like this would end up doing the things he does.

It works well thanks to Joaquin Phoenix who pulls off one of his great performances. A lot like De Niro in The King of Comedy, he starts off as a bit off, but not dangerous until he's pushed to his limit. But as I said, the movie does have him as the main character, but not one your supposed to side with. His evil deeds have merit within his mind and you understand why, especially after his scenes with his mother, other clowns, Thomas Wayne, and even De Niro.

The first half before he transforms is phenomenal. The second half is where things start to slip. It's not because it isn't good, but the tone does start to shift back into comic book territory. A lot of it comes when it makes it's connections to the Wayne family that the movie didn't need. It's easy to ignore a large chunk of that as the final movie was still satisfying. If I had any other problems, it would be that there are several spots where things could have ended upon. I won't spoil it, but get ready to think that the movie is going to end only to go on another ten minutes.

I'll give this eight clown noses out of ten. In terms of it's story, Joker does make for a good psychological look at the famous Batman villain."
818,"As heath ledger's joker said ""madness is like gravity all you need is a push"" Joaquin through his performance has proved it. Through the movie one will witness the fall of a man and the rise of the Joker. Brilliant performance by Joaquin."
819,"Strong in style & acting, weak in social commentary. Entertaining throughout w/ some actual surprises."
820,"I have to admit I like Joaquin's Phoenix work so there's no surprise here that I fell in love with his performance in the movie. Phoenix makes us love a character we grew up to hate through all its other iterations. On top of this, the movie photography is just splendid. Colors usage, lightning, everything is top of class in Joker. Add to that a very human story that makes us understand, at least in this version, the origins of this villain makes this one of the best movies I've seen."
821,"I'm glad I missed the hype train for this. Just got around to seeing it, and It was nice to see it without the crazy headlines. The Oscars got it right. Phoenix was great, similar to Ledger in the Dark Knight he was the best part in a decent movie. There was some thoughtful messages about mental health, and as someone who's had anger management problems, some of the story elements rang true. It actually started a conversation with my partner after the movie, and I said I was lucky to get the help I needed, thankfully there were no cutbacks to the service! But for someone who desperately needs help and can't get it, the world is bleak. And that's what this movie tries to portray.

This movie won't turn you into a crazed g*n man. It doesn't promote violence. But what it does do is explores our relationship with 'civil' society, and what happens when we stop caring about people, and naturally violence is born of this.

Very relevant to what's going on in the real world I'm sorry to say.

Good movie. Not sure I need to see it again anytime soon."
822,"Not sure if the controversy of the film was justified. Have people forgotten taxi driver? This is nothing new and as a comic book film it falls flat. Phoenix is great in the role but there just wasn't enough to go on and it was a muddled mess. I expected so much more from all the hype this film had and maybe that's why I'm just not impressed by it. It's worth a watch for sure but with no sequel... ""THE END"" and no Batman film to incorporate it with, then honestly what was the point anyway?"
823,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
825,"A film really worthy of the batman trilogy. great acting, although sometimes seems a little over the top or too forced, but great nontheless. good message, and a good story.

8/10: almost without flaw"
826,"Absolutely awesome. Best comic film since The Dark Knight Trilogy, Joaquin's performance is simply perfect. Direction and soundtrack fit perfectly and storyline is well executed and well thought out."
827,"I'm Going to start with this : One of the Top 10 best acting performances I've ever seen, Joaquin Phoenix Was Genius. The Movie is Dark, unsettling, physically painful but in a good way. haunting score, Great Soundtrack, Incredible directing and screenplay, the only problem I had with this film is the ending a small problem really, i felt that it needed something more. Anyway this film will be talked about for years to come, i highly recommend it."
828,"At the moment WB announce Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker I was smiling cause I knew this can't flop. Joaquin is a fabulous actor. I was keen to see him portraying my favorite villain and I think The Joker is the most known and impressive villain ever made.

Notes to the people that telling you it's not worth it: Well that's the same people that believes 96 Hours is the best movie they ever seen. They have a limit in taste of movies. Jokes aside don't let them distract you when they say there is no action and clear storyline. It's a drama movie not a highflying stunt movie.

I love the atmosphere and the motions Todd Phillips created. This feels so authentic and convincing. As a Batman fan I knew how the Joker the character itself was buildup and the movie catches more viewers who never had watched a Batman movie or read a comic book. Several brillant actor played Joker in their own way and I really don't like people saying: Every Joker portraying was trash, but Heath Ledgers was perfect. The thing is the other Jokers we've seen in the Batman movies were the character already became the movie doesn't show how things made him become The Joker. An advantage for this movie of course !

The movie has a strong message for people with mental disease and how much impact humanity and respect for each other has on a person. The movie wouldn't be successful if it wasn't about a DC character.

My review might be awful but I'm speechless to go more in detail.

Joaquins acting was outstanding. He really made me think he's a psycho. Such a good acting. I wonder what his secrets are for preparing for this role. I wonder how he acted off screen at the set.

I really hope this movie gets an Oscar since this is the only top movie of the year I have seen I think the chance is very high."
829,"This movie is a dark comedy.the jokes can be funny but this movie is NOT a comedy...It's dark as hell.

The actor that played Arthur Fleck is amazing with how the actor shows how horrible Arthur's life is and how difficult it is to laugh at inappropriate times.

100% GREAT."
830,"Joaquin Phoenix was top but the film could have been better. I expected more but the potential was very limited on his person. I have to admit that I didn't know the story of Joker. The psychological character of Joker is worked out in each detail and the filming location is set up brilliantly. From the theatrical teaser to the release in the cinemas they created a mega hype in the media and under my friends. The votes are no doubt too overrated here. Finally, at the end I felt empty and I thought I saw not the same movie. Now you know what I mean. 6/10."
831,"Joaquin Phoenix gives an outstanding performance as the joker... This film is a masterpiece of how to tell a story that will allow the viewer to watch and feel every bit of emotion, every bit of anger and feel the sadness and frustration of person trying to survive in a city that ridicules and abuses him... The casting in the movie is perfect... I really hope we get another film allowing us to see the progression of this character... Heather Ledger did a fantastic job of bringing the Joker to life but Joaquin Phoenix takes in to another level.. Best film of 2019.."
832,"A mentally unstable performer, who spends his time dressed as a clown, is struggling with life, society, and the environment he is in. His downward spiral forces him to do things that he knows aren't good, but the balance of good and bad is frayed in his mind and it seems that even that bad choices he makes are being met with praise.

While this is comic book inspired, this film is far from the usual colourful adventure film that you might find under the comic book/ superhero genre. The film is dark, dirty, menacing, and unhinged. Joaquin Phoenix plays the titular role of Arthur Fleck, the Joker in decline. This film is intended as a fictional biographic of how the Joker in the Batman comics, became the crime prince of Gotham City. Phoenix does a great job acting and really comes across as unstable. You never quite know if he is living out the past, present or future as reality blurs between many situations. Visually the film is great, I really felt dirty while watching it as the underbelly of Gotham City comes to life in muted and grimy colours. The musical score really backs up and emphasises key moments in the film.

With the cinematography being great, and the acting being excellent, a fantastic score - this is surely a 10 out of 10 then? Unfortunately, not from me. What lets the film down for me is the plot and pacing of the film. It felt at times like it was dragging without a real detailed story or motivation behind the outcomes. Sure, Arthur is on a mental downward slope, but it did not feel as though it was enough to get him to where he ultimately ends up. The journey to the end felt forced and lumbered. Sure, character development needed to occur, but it was slow and with lots of questionable coincidental factors driving it. At 2 hours long it was a struggle staying absorbed at times and by the end of the film I was happier for the end credits than I was for the journey the film tried to take me on. Rather than be branded as an action film, or superhero or even comic book, this felt more like a drama. The testament to a good movie is how many times I'll re-watch it in the future, I can't honestly say I won't be rushing to do that.

Despite the critical acclaim and the reviews exclaiming this is a ""masterpiece of modern cinema"", I'm going to have to put my neck out and say I disagree. An average film which drudges on and is only saved by Phoenix's acting. Yes, it highlights how important it is not to demonise mental health or unstable people for fear of creating a monster, yes it will make you feel uncomfortable, yes it is a different take on traditional stories of the past few years - but masterpiece, no, I'm afraid not. Take away the Joker name and the Batman universe it's supposed to be set in and I think this film wouldn't have garnered the fanboy reaction that it has. There are better films which deal with mentally disturbed individuals spiralling out of control while surrounded by dirty and gritty environments.

I can not give this more than an average 6 out of 10."
834,"Such darkness and grit. This film stands alone outside of all Batman universes and is all the better for it. I thought Joaquin's Joker did not have as much control over chaos as his predecessors, and he would never truly be a comic book super villain, but then this was more grounded in our real world. And that made it all the more frightening."
835,"Just come from a screening and must say this was an incredible film. Phoenix deserves all the glory he is receiving for the lead role. Philip's is restraint and proves he is quite talented outside the usual comedy film. This film is insane and the story beats are unpredictable. As a modern day comic book film, you must admit WB has taken quite the gamble and it has paid off. A darker DC was promised by Snyder, but BVS was a mess of ideas. Joker is interesting and you'll either enjoy or dislike the film. Ambitious and a film with longevity. Will Ratcatcher be introduced in future films?"
836,"It's a movie full of drama and suspense which managed to keep me interested until the end. The evolution of Joaquin Phoenix is the one that really shines, being able to transmit plenty of emotion through every single act, making you ""feel"" what he feels and relate to his suffering and his condition. The filming direction was very good, the acting was great across the board while the finale was also impressive, despite the last part being somewhat predictable.

The not so good parts are regarding the story which although well presented and put together, it becomes quite predictable after the first half (especially for somebody who knows this universe), thus losing some impact and suspense which it had plenty in the first part, or at least until ""Joker"" gets a bit of taste of power.

Overall, it's a very good movie with noteworthy acting and a good plot (especially if you don't know anything about Joker). It can become boring at times and even obvious but the overall experience is good, but nothing extraordinary."
837,"Amazing Acting , plot , directing everything is perfect . one of the best joker origin movie"
838,"This movie was great I must say, it had a darkness looming over the film the whole way through with loads of hilarious moments. I didn't expect this portrayal of joker to be so good, I was disappointed with Jared Lego in suicide squad but they made up for it in Justice League, back to this movie review this movie is definitely in my top 10 would recommend this to everyone i can as you will enjoy every last minute of it!"
840,"I liked it. The story is interesting but predictable. It reminded me of ""The King of Comedy"" from 1982. The plot was convincing and very good. I like that Arthur finally wakes up and becomes the ""evil"" joker. You can't endure everything without consequences."
841,"So Joker is now at #26 in the list of top rated movies of all time in IMDb at the time of writing this. After watching the movie I critically examined the top 25 movies that are ahead of Joker right now, and concluded a few can actually go ahead of this - a very few. And movies like The Dark Knight, The Silence of the Lambs, Fight Club and a few others may not be eligible for sitting ahead of Joker.

All in all, Joker now onwards should be synonym of Joaquin Phoenix. With due respect, the age is Heath Ledger is gone. Joaquin cries, laughs, bleeds, runs, sweats, sings, dances and kills. Gives everything to create a towering character in the history of cinema, and in the history of movie acting. In each frame you can feel the pain of the deprived and dispossessed man. In each frame you can witness how a simple and chaste man can be transformed into a villain by the torments of the society when all of his tries go in vain.

And finally we must congratulate Todd Phillips for this masterpiece and thank him for creating an eternal character here.

92nd Academy Awards:

Best actor: Joaquin Phoenix Best director: Todd Phillips Best movie: Joker."
842,"The movie is good, and the acting is great. However, this story has been retold before. More than once. It just so happens that this time, it is a super villains origin... and those who watch it now, will probably never have watched or seen the original. This is both good and bad... new people who would never watch the original get to enjoy it as well in a new suit (Though not as good), but the old fans get to see Jokers real origin ruined because DC never manages to properly stick to their original stories and have to retell then in slightly different ways 100 times like Batman."
843,I sat through this slowwwwww movie and would gladly have left half way into it. Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie
844,"This ain't an action movie or a super hero movie either. Do not expect Heath Ledger to act in this. Rest In Peace to the best Joker in the entire world. Joaquin Phoenix portrays as Arthur Fleck, suffering from a mental disorder and truly ridicule by the terror of Gotham City society. Seeing what he goes through in his life can really bring a man down to madness. Yes, the key word is madness! It's a prequel to the Dark Knight. In this movie we slowly seeing Arthur become Joker. Don't want to spoil it, because this is a character development movie. I will give Joaquin Phoenix credit as he becomes iconic clown prince of crime. Joker is the best movie of the year!"
845,"This is a really great movie even if you don´t like superheroes movies, if no one tell you that is a movie for the joker you will never know. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix absolutely perfect, the laugh that he trained for over a month is outstanding. For me this is a drama movie, a good one."
846,"You do not need to be a comic book fan to enjoy this movie and it will require no prior knowledge of who Joker is. To me this movie is a psychological study of a man with a hard life and the study of the sociological impacts he is faced with.

To every level of craziness there is a cause and this movie not only shows you the cause but also the effect it can have on ones life. People are not born crazy instead of dismissing individuals as outcasts they need to understand where the root of the problem is and what causes them to act the way they do for this very reason I believe everyone should see this movie.

9/10 for me."
847,"Joker (2019) tells a story about an unbalanced comedian named Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) being disregarded by society. He goes upon a path of self-discovery, in which his mental condition gets worse as the movie progresses.

On the same note, the movie's plot was inspired by both Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. That being said, the movie still manages to find its unique tone without completely copying one of the movie's narrative.

Joaquin Phoenix delivers a oscar-worthy performance. His performance was jaw-dropping - no joke! He went through an extraordinary transformation throughout the entire course of the movie. You really feel sympathy for this guy, and you want him to achieve his goal. That's how good Joaquin is.

This movie is, without a doubt, a piece of art. Whether it's the cinematography, the soundtrack or the cast themselves, they all deliver on it flawlessly.

That being said, this movie is absolutely not for the faint of heart. It contains graphic violence, language, and it can be sometimes pretty depressing. It touches upon various subjects that you don't usually see in a standard Hollywood movie nowadays. Such as: anxiety depression and society itself etc. To some, it can be a problem. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it for those kinds of people.

Verdict: despite its controversy it gained in the past few weeks, Joker proves that there's so much more you can do with a standard comic book movie rather than watching it and forgetting about it afterwards. On the contrary, it approaches the viewers, and it makes them ask questions and think about the movie's existence, and what it has to say. I want to see more movies being made like this. Honestly, I was kind of sick of superhero movies, up until I saw this one. It gave me hope. It shows that there's more you can do with this medium."
848,"Joker is once in ten years movie. This is not a full comic book movie. It's just based on a comic book character. Joker is really slow (which does not bore us) drama which turns upside down in final act. Todd Phillips has done an excellent job in pushing Arthur Fleck into our minds that he will be in your heads for a few days. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. One of the best performances ever by an actor. Robert DeNiro also did a goof job in a small role. The cinematography is so beautiful and captures Gotham and Joker really well. This movie will win atleast a couple of Academy Awards this season. Overall, Joker is a must watch movie and those who don't like this are just jealous how good it is. Move aside Marvel."
849,"Joker is an excellent character study of a man who is descending into a dark madness. It's central theme of how society treats the mentally ill is very strong and well done, and full props must be given to Joaquin Phoenix for his excellent performance.

It's not a perfect film though. It borrows heavily from other sources, and the themes go deep, but not as deep as they maybe could have. Also, the Joker character at the end didn't quite feel right as the movie never took him past angry personal revenge killings to become the outright and indiscriminate psychopath that he is supposed to be.

If you only watch comic book films then this will seem truly mind blowing, but for seasoned cinephiles, it's been done better in other movies. Still, that doesn't take away from what is maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good film - and there's nothing wrong with being a very good film."
850,"There are two sides to the Joker and one side you have sympathy for and the other side is a deranged psychotic killer

This film takes you on a journey and delves into the creation of a monster and his troubled upbringing - you feel sympathy for his mental state but once the monster is unleashed you cannot hold any sympathy

As a stand-alone movie it works well and takes away nothing from Heath Ledgers superb performance - Phoenix's performance is superb and has rightly come in for huge accolades

For me it wasn't the knock out 10/10 that everyone's giving it but it's not my genre - but it's definitely worth seeing whether you're a fab or not or just a fan of anarchy in the purge / v for vendetta tradition

Worth seeing

Pad.A 7/10"
851,"Its definitely not for everyone, and it could be hard to watch for some people, but Joker brilliantly tells a story never told before about the harsh reality of our world and the true tribulations behind daily life, accompanied by Phoenix's Oscar-worthy performance."
852,"I can't complain about the acting but I was a little disappointed that this was more a commentary on mental health than the DC origins story I was hoping for. The climax fell a little short for me too, so I was disappointed overall at what has to have been the most hyped film of the year. Still better than Ad Astra though."
853,"I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!

The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.

ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS"
855,"The real clowns here are the people rating this masterpiece of a movie with less than 8*. There is something really wrong in someone's head when he rates this movie with 1* like it's the worst movie ever made! Ok, we get it snowflakes, you want to feel different. Dissing this great film makes you feel good? Believe me, just stay away from reviews like that, they don't even worth a glance. See this great movie for yourselves. At the least, I guarantee you will not waste your time."
856,"Joker is more than anything else a movie about loss, betrayal, loneliness and the strong humans need and desire to be loved and accepted. Joaquin portraits brilliantly a men who suffers from mental illness & depression as well as rejection & Isolation. Joker is not at all an action movie partly not even entertaining in the classic sense. There's no Happy End but more a reflection of our (current) society in almost every part of the world. If u are different u are out, if u think differently...out, look different ...out, etc. Perhaps it was long overdue to bring to the big screen and to a wider audience an exaggerated anti-hero who is vulnerable and lost. And aren't we all this at least occasionally?"
857,I was numb on the first half of the movie. Shouldn't have watched it because now I can't get over it. I will lose faith in humanity if Joaquin Phoenix is not winning Oscar for this.
858,"From frame 1 to the end of the movie the entire theater gone silent. Every one was engaged till the end.

So dark, they gave 'A' certificate for the movie where the violence were very less than the Deadpool series or literally no nudity or sex scene or no thrilling scene or sound effects. But when we come out we know why a below 18 should not watch this movie.

The hype is 100% true."
859,"Joaquin Phoenix certainly did an impressive, impeccable and magnificent job. I'm very dedicated to the role... Valla prepared himself very well and explained step by step how he managed to characterize himself in the best possible way for his role and how only great actors do: very professional. I am infinitely grateful that he has taken the time to investigate about the disorders, about the drugs, but above all for the time that he has dedicated to perfecting such an important detail as the Joker's laugh, a laugh that is so impactful and full of pain, frustration, anger and in many cases madness. A wonderful experience in the cinema for a lot with a great message, which unlike what has been said, has left me thinking about the responsibility we have in a society that instead of helping feeds violence."
861,"""Joker"" (2019) is a story about a man pushed to his limits from the society around him. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:

Before the review of Joker's contents, a few words need to be said about the controversy and debate Joker stirred prior to its release (and which still persists). Amongst other things, one caution has been that Joker tries to have the audience sympathize with a psychopath who commits violent crimes. The answers to presumptions in that category are very complex. Joker deals with tough topics such as mental illness, poverty, bullying and social class division to an extent where you are likely to feel impacted in some way. However, that doesn't mean that you justify the actions the main character, Arthur - and that is the point a lot of people fails to see. Sympathizing does not equal justifying, and while you can feel pity for the troubles Arthur goes through, you never condone the actions that he takes. Joker is not about that. Joker is about witnessing a man getting crushed under the vices of the people and system around him, and about understanding the role we as citizens and bystanders have in creating Jokers like him.

That being said, this movie is psychologically dark and disturbing. Not purely from the grim and the Kafkaesque tone, but mainly from how real this movie is. Joker sucks you in to a sequence of events that could already be going on in some part of the world - and quite likely is. Nothing feels over-the-top or pushed, whether it be the characters, sexual elements, or even the violence. It all blends together perfectly together with the constantly menacing atmosphere. That is not to say that these elements don't exist or gets noticed - there are for example a few extremely graphic and violent scenes that are very impactful and piercing, but mainly because of their rarity and the underlying pressure behind them.

Technically, this movie is a masterpiece. The cinematography is consistently gorgeous with amazing colors and just the right lighting, and the score is simplistic, hypnotizing and shockingly brutal. The pacing is perfection defined, and the dialogue will be quoted for years to come. Last but not least, Joaquin Phoenix delivers a feat which evolves Arthur into something more than an actor's performance.

That leads us to the final question - does Phoenix's performance live up to that of Ledger's? While the different Jokers explores different sides of the Joker persona, there is little to no doubt that Phoenix has lived up to the sky-high level Ledger set. On a personal note: while I still revel in the chaotic dynamics of the Dark Knight, I ultimately find myself more intrigued and horrified with Arthur Fleck, and his gradual descent into madness, step by step.

My personal grade: a haunting 9/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."
863,"'Joker' is a sick, disgusting, dark, evil, violent, total piece of scheisse. It will seriously affect emotionally troubled young people already pulled at by suicide, addictive behaviors, and hopelessness. It's like a 'Triumph of the Will' for nihilists. I would defer from voting for Joaquin Phoenix for best actor until i see video of his normal non-acting self...it may be he wasn't acting in 'Joker' at all and is one majorly screwed up dude. And, what a weird alien body. He's naked from the waist up a lot in 'Joker' and, from the waist up, is, let's say, disquieting. All taut skin stretched tightly over an alien bone structure. The bones stick up and out at odd angles, in odd places, like the exoskeleton of a medical experiment gone wrong. Not a single pleasant moment in the movie. Not a moment of joy, nor beauty, nor happiness. No catharsis from all the misery and violence, just a stomach churning emptiness at the thought that the last fifty years have come down to this, and this is a circle of despair. A movie without hope, without humanity, showing a world that no sane person would live in."
864,"#Joker is intense, bold, disturbing, and surprisingly poignant at times. Joaquin Phoenix gives a stunning performance that's equally as disturbing as it is emotionally layered. Oscar-worthy in every way. Beautiful cinematography and an incredible score by Hildur Guðnadóttir."
865,"The first half leaves you wondering how this meek, empty shell of a man could ever become the sinister Joker. Then he flips the switch...slowly. I knew as soon as he started dancing down those stairs. I said to myself he really pulled it off. The weird quirks he develops before you are so unnerving, and gritty it makes you feel uncomfortable watching it. It was almost too realistic. But he did something special here. Epic movie"
866,"Rarely does a film exceed the hype like Joker!

it always puts me off when I see rave reviews from critics about a film and really wasn't expecting this film to be as good as it turned out.

The acting by Joaquin Phoenix is a masterful performance, detailing every nuance of the Arthur character.

It sucks you right in to his world and keeps you there for the whole two hours or so - which went by so quickly.

If you are a fan of quality film this is certainly one to watch."
867,Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar. Heath would definitely be proud.
868,"With a Phenomenal performance from Joaquin Phoenix, and Todd Phillips at his best in the directors chair. ""Joker"" is a realistic yet somber portrayal of mental health and societal rejection, told through a perspective of the greatest comic-book villain ever created. ""Joker"" is a brilliant tour de force with spectacular cinematography and will likely become another great staple in our world of Superhero cinema."
871,"Joker Review:

Joker takes place in Gotham City, where mentally-troubled comedian Arthur Fleck embarks on a downward-spiral of social revolution and bloody crime. This path brings him face-to-face with his alter-ego. Who wasn't excited for this? I mean the only thing I was most nervous for was the comparison to The Dark Knight. I love that film and I just wanted something not copying Heath Ledger. These are two different films so it's hard to compare and I won't. The one thing I can say is Joker is amazing and so is The Dark Knight. The mixture of a great storyline and riveting performance by Joaquin Phoenix is what makes this film memorable for me at least. Along with great cinematography and a haunting score. The main thing I'd love to talk about is Joaquin Phoenix. Give that man an Oscar! Every time he was on the screen I couldn't look away. He puts his own new style to the character which I love. For example his laugh. He's not copying the classic laugh that everyone knows. There's a new way of incorporating it in where it feels more real and painful to watch, but in a good way. It's definitely the darkest version of the character that we've seen on screen and that's great. It's raw and real. I could feel for him the entire film, which is hard when the main character is a villain. The approach and descent into chaos we see really aids in our attitudes towards him. Some people, if they really don't like dark material at all, may have trouble with it. Like I said the story is dark but it's a good drama. I don't want to consider it a thriller because it feels too real to me. The one thing I think the story needed was a little bit less inspiration from some films like Taxi Driver. It's a good story but it really paralleled to other stories. I just wanted a little bit more originality, not saying it's not entirely though. One of my favorite stories within it was the relationship with Zazie Beetz's character and Joaquin Phoenix. I felt like it was unnecessary and then a twist happens which I just absolutely loved. I don't know why but it just made me love Arthur so much more. The story is accompanied with a haunting score by Hildur Guðnadóttir, who just won an Emmy for another great score for Chernobyl. It wasn't out there and more subtle which made scenes more unnerving sometimes. It slowly would build and be there. This may sound strange and many don't pay attention to this but I really loved the sound design for this. It was one of the main things I noticed throughout and as the story got more chaotic and scenes broke out into disarray it sounded brilliant to me. I can't explain it. One thing with the chaos is that it just reminder me so much of Darren Aronofsky's mother!. It's a very strange film with lots to say and an unpopular opinion: I think mother! is a perfect film. Anyway those whole scenes are anxiety enduring which is good. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher captures everything so well. I could see both the score and cinematography getting nominations the next Academy Awards. I really don't want to spoil anything and leave you to watch it for yourself. I think this is a brilliant film and will someday become a classic.

My Grade: A-"
872,"Right off the bat, Joaquin Phoenix was quite good in this movie. Other aspects like the cinematography and production design were also very well done. Because of those aspects, I'm giving it 5 stars and not fewer. Sadly, the script just did not live up to the standards the rest of the movie set. My issues are that the screenplay lacks consistency in its depiction of reality, shoehorns in a Thomas Wayne subplot that's included just to make it clear this is a Batman (adjacent) movie, distracts from its own story with on-the-nose references to better films, and worst of all, fails to live up to its aspirations of having a point. The Gotham city that is depicted is wildly uneven throughout this movie, which is a shame because the recreation of grungy 80s New York was very impressive. At times we are meant to believe that this movie could take place in our world, with our grounded sense of reality. At other times it feels like it belongs to Zach Snyder's vision of the DC universe. This mostly comes across due to the characters (or caricatures) that Arthur interacts with. Essentially every single supporting player in this film is completely devoid of any humanity such as motivation or logic, and simply exists as a plot device to hammer home the point that people treat Arthur badly. From the hooligans that rob him (for a sign??) to the cartoonishly villainous Thomas Wayne, Arthur is constantly beaten down by characters who feel like they came straight off a comic book page, into a movie that aims to be as grounded and realistic as it can be. Speaking of Thomas Wayne, the subplot that involves him in Arthur's story is essentially only included to let audiences know that Batman exists in this universe. Yippie. Other than that, it does nothing to further develop Arthur's character (someone should really teach Todd Phillips what character study means). Then there's the Scorsese of it all. Major plot elements, characterizations, and visuals from this movie all significantly borrow from early films by Scorsese like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy (two exceptionally better movies). It got to the point while watching this movie that these on-the-nose ""homages"" pulled me out of the viewing experience and made me think about how much more I'd rather be watching a Scorsese film than this one. Finally, and most egregious of all, this story completely fails to connect its characters and plot to a larger theme or message. It pays lip-service to several possible messages, all of them remain completely unconnected however, leaving an incoherent mess as the only take away. Although this isn't necessarily a criticism of the movie, it is quite aggravating that any reasonable gripe you may have can be defended by some dude-bro by the fact that this film has an unreliable narrator, thus rendering anything that seems broadly drawn or confusing a result of being told an exaggerated story. A better film would have used this to its advantage by immersing the audience more fully into Arthur's subjective mindset, however, the filmmaking keeps the audience squarely in the position of objectively viewing this reality. I'll admit I was never bored while watching the movie, so by that metric I think it's fair to say it's entertaining. However, the more I think about it, the less I like it, which is a massive failing for a movie that strives to be pondered and debated. My guess is that the people rating it 9s and 10s were probably going to give it that high of marks regardless of what happened on screen so take their word with a grain of salt."
873,"It's just a bad movie. It is slow, boring and disturbing."
874,A movie about stand up comedy. I like the bit where he accidentally shot the gun
875,"Joker's like getting in a time machine and going back to 1983 and watching a movie that was made without modern restraints to be thought provoking & entertaining, definitely NOT made to be PC, LGBT or appeal specifically to the Chinese or any minority. Joker was made for all mankind. The bought and paid for mainstream media critics will hate Joker, but true film fans will leave having seen something unapologetically original and unimaginably enjoyable. Joker resembles Taxi Driver or Platoon for getting in your head with brutal honesty and never leaving."
876,"Joker was one of the most anticipated movies of the year and it certainly lived up to all the hype. Although the movie starts off slow, once the ball gets rolling it gets better and better. In a word, the movie was incredible. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing as Arthur Fleck who slowly descends into madness as he adopts his alter ego Joker.

Set in Gotham City in 1981, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) works as a clown who is barely clinging onto his day job. Arthur suffers from a neurological condition that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times and is also seeing a psychologist who encourages him to keep a journal as well as prescribing him medication for his mental illness. Arthur also lives with his ailing and mentally ill mother Penny (Frances Conroy) in a downtrodden apartment. Arthur also aspires to become a stand up comedian which attracts the attention of talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) of whom Arthur idolises. After several events which contributes to Arthur's self destruction and descent into madness, Arthur adopts his alter ego Joker and blazes a trail of murder, chaos and delusional behaviour.

Although Joker is set in the DC Comics universe, Joker does well as a standalone movie going back to the beginning and director Todd Phillips (The Hangover) is handed the creative reigns to do whatever he wanted with the infamous character in an alternate world that completely detaches itself from the Batman series.

Joaquin Phoenix was amazing and I'm tipping that he will be netting several awards for his performance. Putting aside the previous performances of Joker in the past, Joaquin Phoenix earns himself a spot amongst elite company alongside Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Cesar Romero and Jared Leto who have portrayed the Joker in past movies and TV shows.

Robert De Niro is excellent as TV show host Murray Franklin of whom Arthur Fleck idolises. Robert De Niro's character pays homage to his character in The King of Comedy (1983).

Zazie Beetz (Deadpool) does a great job as Arthur's sympathetic neighbour of whom he befriends.

Frances Conroy does well as Arthur's ailing mother who is also suffering a mental illness that may have been passed onto her troubled son.

Many themes the movie explores include mental illness which is a major focus point throughout the movie as well as bullying, dealing with traumatic events, abuse, neglect, and failings of the government including unemployment, rising crime rates, and the broken medical system which take place in an alternate Gotham City.

Joker also paid homage to the classic movie Taxi Driver (1976) also starring Robert De Niro who played the troubled anti-hero Travis Bickle who too, descended into self destructive behaviour, similar to Arthur Fleck's Joker.

Intense, violent, shockingly realistic, and a chilling performance from Joaquin Phoenix left me lost for words long after the end credits rolled as I left the cinema. Joker was an amazing film and I can safely say that it is one of the best films of 2019.

9/10"
877,"Joaquin Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, the man who would be Joker. The entire movie is a character study on this man, with little themes interlaced such as mental illness and the divide between the wealthy and the poor. Unlike other attempts at the Joker's origin, this one did not take one bad day, but years and years of relentless abuse, trauma, and depression. We watch Arthur as he goes from one miserable day to the next, as everything gets worse and worse, and then he gets kicked while he's down for good measure (sometimes literally). This makes it a long, miserable, and uncomfortable viewing experience. The character we all know as Joker is barely present until the film's third act. Until then it's just Arthur Fleck and his descent into madness in a cruel and uncaring world.

Joaquin Phoenix deserves every drop of praise he's getting. Every little bit of it. He's dream casting for a role like this, as it feels like Joker was written for him and only him. He's always been fantastic with tormented characters, those who skirt the borders of insanity. And not just movie insanity, but actual insanity. The darkness one's mind goes to when all hope is lost and happiness is an unknowable entity, when waking up every morning feels like stepping into a cold void, where you're trapped in your own head, you can't tell what's real and what's delusion. Phoenix taps into those feelings like a walk in the park. He slips into the role so well you have to keep slapping yourself to remind you you're empathising with a sociopath. His take will divide audiences. Some will find him hilarious, like a dark mirror of Charlie Chaplin, while others will watch him with intense sadness.

Nothing encapsulates this better than his laughs. Yes, laughs, plural. Phoenix is not happy with just one iconic laugh. Instead he gives Joker a number of distinct laughs, and each of them are just as unnerving and characterful as the others. His fake laugh is the closest to a typical Joker laugh we get. He uses it at odd, inappropriate moments, or as an attempt to fit in with those around him. The way he cuts from a serious expression to manic laughter, and then back to a serious expression is equal parts hilarious and disturbing. He's lonely and detached from society. He doesn't know what makes a good joke. He doesn't find humour in the same things everyone else does, so in an effort to appear normal he puts on a fake laugh; over-the-top and terrible. His other laugh is an involuntary tick due to a mental condition, either from illness or injury. It's loud and hearty. And yet also grossly inappropriate. This time it isn't Arthur trying to fit in, it's a reflex he can't help, and usually comes out in moments of great stress or sadness. These moments are uncomfortable to watch because you can feel his desperation to make them stop. These are tragic, painful laughs masking tears.

The other star of the movie is Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting and upsetting score. It's a stripped-down orchestral score, centred on a handful of cellos. It evokes the tragic nature of Arthur's life, while also remaining dark and tense, putting you at constant unease. It uses silence and atmospheric lulls brilliantly, allowing the rest of the film to breathe before the overpowering single Cello line bursts back in. Even in Joker's final triumphant moment at the end of the film, the score still feels overpoweringly dark and brooding. This is no hero we're witnessing, this is a villain of pure evil and insanity.

Joker is not your average comic book movie. Go in expecting a typical superhero origin and you'll be disappointed. There's no antagonist, no brazen action sequences. It's slow and methodical, the violence is sudden and disturbing, but used incredibly sparingly. Also for a film entitled 'Joker' it's not particularly funny either. It has its moments of genuine humour for sure, but usually the level of comedy is so dark you'd feel bad for laughing at it. There was a guy in my screening who, much like Arthur, was laughing at the most inappropriate moments and literally applauding the violence. It was like Arthur was in the cinema with me watching his own movie. It was unnerving, but mostly I couldn't understand how he didn't see the irony in it. You'll either find this movie a darkly hilarious comedy, or find the experience closer to a deeply upsetting traumatic event. We may never see another film like this, but it may also open the eyes and minds of major studios to what they can achieve with comic book material. An R-rated villain origin, in the style of a gritty indie drama, focussing on the depravity of mental illness. I give Joker a potentially industry-changing 9/10."
878,"Following Christopher Nolan's smash triumph with The Dark Knight, Hollywood fell in love with a three-word phrase: ""Dark and Gritty."" Many in the business felt that the film's more serious tone and anguished protagonist were what spectators appreciated, and it ended up propagating a new tentpole mentality. It affected not only the future of DC Comics adaptations, but also titles like Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man and Dean Israelite's Power Rangers, by injecting real-world cynicism into what were formerly bright and colorful characters. ""Dark and gritty,"" on the other hand, was a misinterpretation of what made The Dark Knight so unique.

It's not that Nolan's film was more serious than the traditional comic book blockbuster of the period; rather, it refused to be labeled merely as a ""superhero movie."" It helped to reframe what a big-screen tale about a masked vigilante could entail. It took all of the traditional components that had been in the source material for decades and applied a cinematic language in a way that audiences had never seen before, with Michael Mann's heist film Heat serving as a key reference point.

The union resulted in a completely new and thrilling experience. Fortunately, this was not an insight that went unnoticed by the entire filmmaking community, since it was important in the years that followed, albeit in a smaller way. While ""dark and gritty"" became a buzzword that fueled a slew of underwhelming films, we've also seen incredible films like Joe and Anthony Russo's Captain America: The Winter Soldier (which drew inspiration from 1970s conspiracy thrillers like Sydney Pollack's Three Days of the Condor) and James Mangold's Logan (which tapped into Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven's neo-western energy). These are films that stand out as really outstanding cinematic achievements, not just extensions of their respective brands.

Todd Phillips' Joker comes from the same school, and once again, both comic book enthusiasts and cinephiles are treated to something special. While the approach and subject matter come with a natural and profound unpleasantness, they also provide a foundation for a compelling and rattling character study that presents the titular villain in a light unlike anything seen in a previous incarnation."
879,"I was very nervous when I went to see this film. The joker character is one of my favorite ch of all time, and I was worried showing the characters origin story would take away the mystery and make him less interesting. This film however put so much thought and effort into his background that I left the theater completely in love. Joaquin phoenix did a perfect job playing as Arthur, and he absolutely deserves that Oscar. He is without a doubt the best part of the film. I cried, cheered, was worried and in suspense fall throughout the film because of him. Everytime I watch the film I discover something new that adds more to the story. There is so much detail shown throughout the film that it really makes me appreciate how much effort Todd Phillips put into this film. There are so many different ways to interpret the film that it constantly has me evaluating it trying to come up with different theories as of what's going on. There are a few flaws I noticed, or at least small things that bothers me. But the good heavily outweighs the bad, and the flaws I've noticed don't take away from the story or the drama. This film is truly a must see. The cinematography, acting, drama, story, and score is done so wonderfully that you'll always be engaged"
880,"JOKER Release date October 4th, 2019 Audience REACTIONS at its North American PREMIERE: 😄😄😄😄😄 (5 laughs) 😱 (1 shock) 🏆 (strong Oscar potential)

Joker (Todd Phillips) provides a divergent take on perhaps the world's most famous fictional villain. Incredibly adept at world building, the film portrays the spirit of the character and the society that failed him through the imagery of the dark city, Gotham. The director described the film as a ""slow burn"", and it was indeed a very slow burn. One should go into the film expecting something very different than the superhero movies we already know the Joker from. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal provides a humanizing origin for the villain. While the viewer knows the character ultimately becomes a villain, it is easy to forget that, seeing instead a troubled man in a broken society; someone who just needed some compassion and kindness. Raising questions about the failings of our own society, it calls for introspection. Joker can first appear bland, but the more one considers it, the more deeply it is felt."
884,"""Joker"" (2019) is one of the greatest Dc films ever made only being beat by Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight Trilogy"". I can remember the ""hype"" for this film being absolutely insane the media was claiming that this film would cause a ""incel"" uprising within society. Pretty crazy stuff honestly but regardless of that this is a great film Author Fleck is a great reiteration of the iconic ""Joker"" character and De Niro was great as always."
885,"This tale of Joker's descent into madness has legitimate pathos. Joaquin Phoenix here is not charismatic, but sad and pathetic-not in the derogatory sense of the word, but in the sense of appearing skinny, having a cruel neurological condition, and being constantly misjudged, and in deserving pathos, or our sympathy. Sometimes, it did seem like this world of this newly created Joker struggled to fit with the comic book character we know from the Batman franchise. While Joker's slow burn into violent activity was believable, it was less believable that the same descent could lead him into becoming a super villain. Joaquin's Joker doesn't seem to have much agenda for the grand scale. His violent actions are all personal and reactive. This Joker falls into becoming a symbol for a protest movement, which doesn't feel quite a product of Gotham but of hasty scriptwriting. The film does its best to mix outcast themes, clown imagery and mental illness all in one to create the Joker, but something more than clown makeup is missing from the equation.

""Joker"" is an uncomfortable and magnetic film. It uses several kinds of storytelling devices to disorient our sense of reality, sometimes successfully and other times not completely enough. Its use of soundtrack is compelling but also less than fully consistent. The era of the when the film occurs confuses itself between the 40s, the 60s, the 80s and the present 2000s. The soundtrack is pulled from a variety of these decades as well, and adds to that feeling of disorientation. The Batman franchise spans these decades, so gives meaning to their reference, but also warps the viewers frame of reference in assessing the important themes of the film. Is there a reason most of the social workers Alex Fleck/Joker encounters are black? Is this a statement of some kind, or a metaphor for projection, or just part of the demographic of the time?

Anyway, not to overshadow the fact that this is a movie dealing with complex psychology of an unsettling but humane kind, and that this film that makes viewers uncomfortable somehow remarkably landed a wide audience and mass acclaim. Well, not remarkably. Any Batman movie would. But that this movie got made is quite a feat.

While this movie isn't anything about incels (it's not a movie about perpetual virginity or anything 2000s, I think), it is probably the one movie most having to do with the fear of violence modern society has for those it has outcast. With this film I think it's possible to have more empathy than fear. However, there are some problematic messages that comes up by meshing together a story of an isolated, troubled, but rather ordinary person with a desire for simple joy, and that of a uniquely celebrated anarchist super-villain like Joker. These two characters don't quite relate, and perhaps shouldn't."
886,"Great film and didn't get bored!

I'd been told not much happened but couldn't take my eyes off the screen..

Went pretty dark at times but I think it needed to, a fantastic performance from Joaquin & Bob!

Go see it people.."
887,"I have to fan geek out on this FILM! It is simply one of the most perfect efforts in cinema ever. If JOKER does not rake in awards or more specifically multiple Oscars I will be befuddled! Joaquin Phoenix always delivers a masterful performance in all of his movies however this performance is truly magnificent. I was spellbound by him and by so much more. This music is phenomenal and high praises to Hildur Guðnadóttir!!!!! I will be seeking this brilliant composer to listen more of. Lawrence Shers' cinematography was beautiful and the film color/saturation was so spot on!!! KUDOS! Editing? Beautifully done!!!! Thanks to Jeff Groth and his team if he has one! I could keep singing about this movie but I will spare everyone....but damn, the man who brought it all together, director Todd Phillips. Masterful job!!!!! I wanted to stand up and cheer during the credits.... :) LOVED IT!"
888,"This is an absolute masterclass in character acting from Joaquin Phoenix, not so much a superhero/villain story, it is more of a study of mental health issues in society today, drug addiction and the social issues facing people who society has left behind, you will struggle to find any actor who deserves the oscar this year"
890,"The best live action joker by far, the plot is designed form him to shine and Joaquin gives proves that he is probably the best actor alive."
891,"To say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading. Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.

The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it."
892,"Joker speaks volumes, wether it'd be with it's social commentary on present times, or within it's own context. This movie is powerful, intense, and real. Todd Phillips has outdone himself both in directing and writing, he has shown us he has the capacity to make not only a great film, but a film that will leave you thinking for days to come.



Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck is nothing short of mesmerizing. He downright carried this film alone, that's not to say the supporting cast didn't do a good job either, everyone was solid. But Joaquin, he's a whole other beast in his own league. From making you go from sympathetic, to empathetic, to terrified of him. His transformation from Arthur to Joker was masterfully done, the pacing was great and the subtle hints and changes you'd get from him made the payoff much more satisfying. This man deserves an Oscar, and he WILL get that Oscar, period.



The cinematography and lighting of this film set the tone so well for it, there was some interesting shots pulled and it really gives you that Gotham feel to it. Dark, gritty, and full of crime. The color palette was beautiful and it was used to it's full extent. The soundtrack was astonishing, the oustide songs were used accordingly and added to scenes perfectly. As well as the original score from Hildur Guonadóttir made every scene intense, horrifying, and all the more real when paired with Joaquin's performance. She is truly a force to be reckoned with, there would be no surprise if she gets an Oscar nomination as well.



This movie is special, it shall be remembered and used as an example for years to come. No words can describe the sheer amount of effort and care that was put to this film, please go watch this movie, for it is not only a film for entertainment, its an unforgettable experience. I can't put into words my feelings for this film, but to keep it nice and short, Joker is a masterpiece.



10/10"
893,"Set in the early 80s in Gotham City, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a struggling clown dealing with urban decay, mental illness, lack of access to social services, and disillusionment with society itself as he heads down a path of violence and chaos that will give rise to Batman's arch nemesis, Joker.

The result of Phoenix's desire to do a character study of something comic book related and Todd Phillips' desire to move away from comedy into edgier material. Joker was a significant departure from the types of comic book fare Warner Bros. was previously adapting under their DC Label. While films like Deadpool and Kingsman had shown that big budget R-Rated comic book movies can yield blockbuster results comparable to PG-13 movies, Joker was an aggressively grim and modestly budgeted character movie that didn't have blockbuster airs like previous films of similar ilk. Against all established studio mindets Joker managed to become not just one of the biggest comic book movies of 2019, but one of the biggest movies of 2019 period as the 6th highest grossing film of that year. The film also became the first R-Rated feature to gross $1 Billion at the box office, and scored a best actor Oscar for Joaquin Phoenix making this the second time an Oscar was given for playing the character (after Heath Ledger's posthumous award for 2008's the Dark Knight). While I respect the accomplishments garnered by the film, I found myself somewhat underwhelmed by the movie itself.

I think my major issue with Joker is that it often feels at odds with itself. On one hand it's trying to be an origin story for Joker, and on the other it's trying to emulate the gritty street films of 70s filmmakers like Walter Hill, Michael Winner, and Martin Scorcese. Scorcese's influnece is particularly heavy here as there's near identitical elements take from Scorcese's The King of Comedy and appropriated in Joker as a kind of homage (if I had to guess). The movie certainly captures the look popularized by these filmmakers as the scenes in 1980s Gotham are very inspired by the ""fear city"" image of grime, sleaze, filth, and rot that had plagued the city during those years, but while these elements are well done they feel crudely inserted into the world of Batman where we're supposed to accept that these characters who are pop culture icons are going through this, and it's just odd to have these DC comics characters attached to a narrative like this. The movie places these elements of the Batman mythos that have a tendency to make themselves noticed and they just don't mesh in a world that is heavily inspired by 1970s 42nd Street in New York. Even allowing for the DC iconography, the movie doesn't have much of a focus on what it's commenting on. At one point it's celebrity culture, then at another point it's urban decay, at another it's wealth disparity and so on and so forth with the film bouncing between different aspects of society as seen through Arthur's point of view.

The movie is trying to be like The King of Comedy where it tries to mimic the journey of Rupert Pupkin to Arthur Fleck, but Arthur Fleck doesn't feel real. Rupert Pupkin felt real because he felt like a tangible presence based on real life celebrity obsessed individuals with a tenuous grasp on reality. Arthur Fleck at no point feels ""real"" because he's a fun house mirror exaggeration of every bad end result of society's failures. He's mentally ill, he's abused, he's poor, and so on and while I'm not saying these occurrences can't happen together in real life, here it feels like it's done because the movie needs Arthur Fleck to become Joker by the end of the movie so it goes the Job route of taking anything and everything it can away from Fleck so the narrative drives him to being the Joker.

With that said, Joaquin Phoenix is really good as Arthur Fleck/Joker and does a good job of disappearing into the role. The pain he conveys on his face even when laughing maniacally is quite heart wrenching and properly uncomfortable and the quiet misery through which Fleck carries himself is well conveyed. Phoenix won an Oscar for this performance and you can certainly see why.

Joker is a frustrating movie. It's made watchable thanks to a strong performance for Joaquin Phoenix as the central character, but it borrows from urban films of the 70s and jigsaws them together into a movie that doesn't carry the context or weight these elements had when they were introduced in other films. On a technical and tonal level it certainly nails the look of many of its inspirations but there's a hollowness to the whole affair that leaves a feeling of ""so what?"""
894,Saw this movie in the after noon the week after it's release. Yea very disturbing and unsettling but what do you expect from a movie that has a mentally psycho clown in the front and center? I freaking loved every minute of this movie. Even Gotham looked fantastic and I think this is the best looking Gotham ever. Sorry Chris Nolan even though you made the best Batman films. Phoenix really sold it. His portrayal of the Joker was completely realistic and all of his laughs were so well done. The story was great as well. I highly recommend this film
895,"Joker is the character sketch of Arthur Fleck, a young man aspiring to be a stand up comedian but suffering from multiple psychological and physical disorders. One of his serious shortcomings is that when he is nervous, he laughs uncontrollably, thus giving those around him the impression of ridicule and impunity. His strange mannerisms add to the complexity leading to Arthur becoming the cynosure of social ostracism and wholesome rejection, including physical excesses. He lives with his mother Penny, a debilitated woman also with mental issues. Arthur's life is one of an almost invisible and reclusive existence, something that's not acceptable to him. The social repulsion takes its final toll when the psychologist treats him with utter contempt and cuts off his medication. The situation sends him spiralling down into a psychological spin resulting in a social revolt and unbridled violent crimes that he has no remorse for.

That's the birth of Joker for you which will connect with The Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne. Joker is an extremely volatile and complex character for whom your heart may cry out for sympathy in a moment and almost simultaneously look for a social rationale for his return to socially acceptable behaviour. Joaquin Phoenix has gotten under the skin of the character, yearning for sympathy, yet loathsome and abhorrent. Such maniacal is his demonstration of the nadir of his existence that the glorification of which has perhaps no comparison in modern times. Joker justifies the need of a vigilante for the return of control over Gotham, reeling from riotous behaviour of the less fortunate. The intensity of the character, physical nuances, volatility and subterfuge related histrionics of Joaquin Phoenix are in a class seldom witnessed in cinema - he pretty much is the prelude to Heath Ledger's Joker, almost seamlessly justifying the character. This rendition does deserve the standing ovation it got and is worth its weight in gold. Take a bow director Todd Phillips!"
896,"Juaquin Phoenix was riveting, intense, believable, depressing, and wonderful. He WAS Arthur Fleck. Definitely not for children. Very deep and makes you stop to think about how you truly treat people."
897,"Like a train setting off slowly as it chugs away from its station of departure, this movie starts off slow, as it needed to, to create and develop the story of the Joker - a pre 'Batman' character enhancing psychopath.

The movie continues and develops, grows, prospers and finishes crashing into the world of Joker as we start to know him in Batman.

The movie itself is very clever, a very different take on the character. Atmospheric, & entertaining and pulls you into the world of a man that makes you understand how a 'man' like Joker comes to pass.

Although, 'the' Phoenix has risen - he truly has become a special actor. Dare I say the best in the world currently? It takes a lot to go from fantastic to the elite level of special - I feel that a number of his performances have built up to this - and can't help but feel that this part was made for him.

I heard a lot at chatter - is this a better performance than that of the late Heath Ledger? And well, yes it is.. Both performances are 'fantastic', Joaquin's however is just that bit more 'special'."
898,If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for this then the Academy Awards will be a laughing stock even more than what it is now
899,"Amazing acting, great storyline and keeps you wanting more. I've not been to the cinema for 10 years and Joker was worthy of the visit. Can't recommend this movie enough. Will the making of the riddler be the next movie?"
900,"Derivative of taxi driver. If I took off points for originality, everything that isn't from the 1900's would get a zero. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic. I really like the way the film is shot. There are some plot threads that don't really go anywhere, one twist that is super predictable, and one moment that REALLY didn't need to be in the movie. Overall, I would recommend, but please, go watch taxi driver."
901,"""Joker"" is a daring, unsettling and masterful character study that will leave you in awe. . In this psychological thriller, a mentally ill failed stand-up comedian named Arthur Fleck, turns to a life of crime in Gotham City. . The thing I absolutely loved about ""Joker"" is the slow burn. From the opening shot, Phoenix and Phillips are able to convey a knot in your stomach and that feeling doesn't go away until long after you've seen the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is the real deal. A complete game changer in method acting, he is hypnotizing. That is the perfect word to describe the performance; hypnotizing. A true Oscar contender and it will be hard to beat his performance because it is the best of the year. Will I compare Phoenix's performance to Heath Ledger's? No. That was the past and this is the now, and Phoenix's performance is what we need now. Aside from being a brilliant stand alone film, ""Joker"" pays hommages to so many great films of its genre from the 70s and 80s. The cinematography is outstanding and the score is simply haunting. I'll also mention that you will never listen to Frank Sinatra's ""That's Life"" the same again. Bottom line: yes, you should see this movie. ."
903,"Let me start off by saying the cinematography is as good as people say. The acting is also truly impressive and for those that are not into comic book movies this should be a great depiction. But that's also where I find myself wondering how people are even putting Joker into the same ballpark as The Dark Knight. The issue I have is the same issue I had with Suicide Squad. The Joker isn't just an insane man causing chaos as far as he walks. He is calculated and intelligent. Striking the perfect balance between insane and I wonder is it all an act. In this movie I only witnessed an mental disturbed man with pain in is life go off the rails. I never felt he had the capacity to formulate a world ending plot, bit rather just finds himself fortunate to have everything fall in place. Still a great movie,it's just not The Joker."
904,"First , this movie made me start an account to write a ""review "" . I completely dont understand all the good ratings and praise for this movie . Also it always hurts when this type of movie could have lot to offer , but for me was nothing more then total let down . I dont like the Joker caracter at all in this movie , not a good joker in my book . Combined with a story that doesnt manage to pull me in or do anything at all for me , i felt this movie was boring pretty quick , and im an easy goin guy that can manage to put brain on hold for a movie if needed , normally it would take some longer before i start thinking ; hey ,i may be watching a bad movie here. I can handle some graphic violence , i wasnt sure if it really served a purpose here . Because of all these type of reviews , u start wonder if something is wrong with majority of people , or am i totally out of touch with a new reality . I never watch any review or trailer beforehand . I always use this website to find reviews of similar minded people , then have more entertainment then the movie i watched before and gives some piece of mind . To be sure it wasnt me on a bad day i rewatched the movie and still found it complete garbage . I rate lowest possible because the high scores , but not sure if i would be willing to give any more if had lower rating , as i really did not like anything about it . Because the joker is so badly , wrong displayed in the movie , and i feel a really good movie about the Joker would not be that amazingly hard to make , this is just dissapointing beyond words , all the good reviews , i dont understand at all and is both annoying and disturbing ."
905,"""Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?"" wails Arther Fleck ( Joker) who wears a mask and is an aspiring stand up comedian who just wants to be loved and accepted by society. The setting is Gotham city which is presently in a lockdown due civic problems. The people are protesting against the unpopular Mayor who had called them clowns. This character has already been played out by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in previous versions of the film and they have made the character of joker memorable and iconic. Now director Todd Phillips gives his own interpretation of the character and with the help of actor Joaquin Phoenix, he has made a near masterpiece. The joker is a loving son to his ailing mother. In a memorable scene he is shown bathing her. In his vulnerable moments he asks for love and respect from the public. He is looking for a father figure since his mother has told that his father had abandoned them earlier. She had hinted that the mayor is his father. He speaks to the mayor only to be rejected downright. He lands in a job of looking after children but his posession of a gun causes him trouble with the administration. The joker has a serious problem in that he suddenly breaks out into involuntary uncontrollable laughter ( a kind of Tourette's syndrome) at any place and he can't stop. This gets him frequently into trouble. For this he carries a card explaining this physical condition to the shocked people. On various occasions the joker has been called a psychopath ,sadist , murdering maniac, crown prince of crime etc . He gives vent to his frustration by indulging in violence. The film has quite some footage of graphic mind numbing killings at periodic intervals. Joaquin deserves a standing ovation for a superlative performance. He carries the entire film on his shoulders. Robert De Nero has been wasted in a insignificant small role. The film has got two much deserved Oscars for actor Joaquin and music both being the highlights of the film. The film is first rate and falls in the must watch category."
906,"What we are seeing is the widening wealth gap, the high concentration of political and economic power and cultural power in televisions; the failure of thorough communication between people in the run-down cities, and the already miserable underlying society. Cruel mutual harm. If the patterning of these background details is mild and still interacts to a certain degree with the protagonist, then the most vivid social description in the film is highly rigid. The bottom group, with clowns as the cultural banner, was able to raise their arms in search of equality at first, but was later presented as the ""Wuhe people"" which is most easily understood in the patchwork."
907,"New York, during the latter half of the nineteen seventies and tipping into the nineteen eighties was financially bankrupt; an explosion of destitution, crime, immorality and insanity. This feature, within ""Joker"", has its parallels within the realm of a New York city that we see here set against an old crumbling fictitious Gotham City, ruined, too, by bankruptcy, crime, immorality and madness. This, unfortunately, is the home of one Arthur Fleck. A man that leaves very little mark on his surroundings and all those he meets. He's a man who supports both himself and his aging, dependent mother through work as a party clown; putting on a happy face. His councillor and many medications say otherwise.

He's a man stoical in his ways. He's a man who travels by bus. He's a man who, still, lives with his mother. Arthur Fleck is a proletariat of a nondescript nature. Arthur Fleck is a victim. Arthur Fleck is both lonely and insane.

Born of frustration, this alienated soul has befallen prey to cruel indifference from a society that leaves only a pinprick of light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel but at the same time, this very same soul, leaves an indelible speck of growing self-pity and grudge bearing resentment toward oneself and for those who reject, pour disdain and derision to those who grasp for the light. Only darkness pursues within the mind of one Arthur Fleck.

The world of Arthur Fleck is perpetuated by an eerie soundtrack throughout this film set against the grating, monotone effect of Ms. Hildur Ingveldar Guðnadóttir's (b.1982) haunting violoncello as too Arthur Fleck's own lifebuoy of classic and contemporary tunes to render or pacify his state of mind. This leading composition of soundtracks' and inner signature tune conjoins beautifully with the visual production of the films landscape. Here we see, hear and feel for this poor, lost soul. It is here, in a Gotham that is unforgiving we see the final phase of this man's inner sanctum finally crumbling around him; his cognitive dissonance hits hard. Extremely hard. Reawakening as all that he sees, hears and feels.

This premise, in part, though very slight, but recognisable, has a parallel to Paddy Chayefsky's (1923-1981) disillusioned, but also reawakened, character ""Howard Beale"" played by Peter Finch (1916-1977) in the 1976 film ""Network"", Arthur Fleck, too, is ""...I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore..."".

This too can coincide with the films reference to Charlie Chaplin's (1889-1977) 1936 feature ""Modern Times"" by comparing Arthur Fleck to the feckless and bumbling character known as ""A Factory worker"". No matter how hard he tries, all is in vain.

This context of this feature may run alongside the ""The Joker"" universe, the universe that is D.C. proper, but this portrayal runs wider here to a degree that ""The Joker"" as an individual, an arch nemesis of good and more central to the Gotham elite and to be judged by the company that he keeps is unique and separate within his individual universe. Here Arthur Fleck, now ""Joker"", is a sum of its parts, here he is more than representative. He is everyone. He is symbolic of a society that understands and empathises and experiences' his woes; they too are ""...as mad as hell...and not going to take it anymore..."".

With the assistance of Messrs Phillips, Silver and Mr. Phoenix alike this character study, and social introspective, of a downward spiral into self-destructiveness is, once more, more than a sum of its parts; It is beautifully shot, the colours and texture that run across the screen, the defining musical personas, the personalities within these back alleys and mean streets, its sociological perspective more than blends atmosphere and tone it catapults the whole hypothesis into a stark and extremely bold cautionary tale of the delicate line of how culture, of how civilisation can seemingly implode but that the last joke just well may be on us all."
909,"Being a big batman guy I always thought the Joker worked better without a backstory. But I also love my dark psychological movies, so this still sounded like it was going to be ace, and it is!

This isn't an action movie. It's a character study/back story and it has you feeling both sorry for and being creeped out by Phonex. Who (as everyone is saying) is amazing in the movie.

This is a well told, expertly made, gritty drama which grabbed my attention in a way that over the top CGI hasn't for a while now. This film is well paced, unpredictable and shocking in all the right places. DC made the right choice in getting creative and not sticking to the superhero formula here."
910,"Joaquin Phoenix delivers the Oscar worthy performance of a man who succumbs to madness after being dealt a bad hand in life. This movie shows that mental health is both crippling and incredibly powerful to a man who embraces madness as a coping mechanism.

Joker saddens, shocks, and enthrals you. It incites thought and discussion. It truly is a must-see movie. WOW!!"
911,"Somewhat hallow, in the end. Some memorable scenes. A subjective experience. A bit boring in areas. A bad ending."
912,"As of writing this there are 317,711 IMDB user votes, of which 9,654 are below 6/10.

That's 3% of people that hated this film... for every 100 people, 3 people are C U N T S.

Sounds about right in this day and age.

10/10 great movie. Loved it. Will see it again, forget the dopes!"
914,"Joker

Words completely fail me, I just had to sit through two hours of watching an alcoholic in Judy and now I am made to sit for two hours watching a lunatic in Joker. In both I was neither educated, entertained or informed. Both movies were utter cobblers and should be cast into the void where they will find the ultimate turkey that is Carry-On Columbus.

This purported to be an origin story of master villain extraordinaire, Joker. We got zilch on how he became a master criminal, he had no henchmen, we had no bank robbery, we had no car chase, we had no joker, and on top of that his arch nemesis Batman was a small boy when they were contemporaries. This was incoherent nonsense.

Joaquin Phoenix's performance had so many problems,

1, he dominated the movie by being in every scene, true, but the story was so unfocused it became an interpretation of a man struggling with a mental health condition. The main problem was the Joker was not an interesting character, he was bland, predictable and revolting.

2, his characterisation rested upon physicality, he lost weight, he was half naked, he contorted his body, with the inference twisted body twisted mind, does Hollywood really think an audience can be duped by such an obvious trick, this was no Raging Bull or Dallas Buyers Club. I wanted to pass the hat around the cinema to raise funds to buy him a shirt and then make him wear it.

3, We had raw method style from Joaquin that was largely improvised to fill the void. There must always be a reason behind behaviour otherwise it is meaningless and so it was here.

4, The Joker, unsurprisingly, it's in the name, was funny, if he was sad, it was pathos, this was unremittingly morose. Jack Nicholson's performance captured this but it was absent here.

This was a miserable, instantly forgettable movie that lacked any focus or story. Around me there was a constant stream of people walking out who felt they had been sold a pig-in-a-poke, and went to watch Aladdin instead, as did I."
915,"I don't need to say much here except it was beautiful, harrowing, thought provoking. Phoenix's acting was so profoundly deep and moving that I cried throughout. Insanely good."
916,"This movie has to be one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar, without a doubt. The amount of work that he put into this film paid off. Such a dark and creepy movie. Will definitely be going back to theaters to rewatch. Loved it!"
917,"Much has been written about how this movie draws upon 1970s-80s genre predecessors, so I'll spare mention of the obvious ones. What I saw draws heavily on ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (1947), right down to Phoenix's use of Danny Kaye's hand movements, except he forces them through the twisted bodily machinery of a madman. The plot is mostly standard pathos: loss of the social safety net, uncertain parentage, social awkwardness, untreated mental illness, extreme physical bullying. What makes it work for me is how each 'life' within Arthur's head is an unresolved dream brought on by the loss of access to 'medications': magnetic boyfriend? creepy stalker? failed entertainer? multiple murderer? overnight media sensation? dutiful son? matricidal maniac? socio-political cult sensation? It doesn't matter that any one of those fantasies is resolved, because Arthur is ultimately happy right where he was all along: in the asylum. The plot device of the 'case file' makes this clear. How will fit Batman into this universe, where the villain isn't one and isn't a cartoon bent on corrupting or intoxicating minds, because he doesn't have to? We shall see."
918,"I thought the pacing of the film was a bit slow to begin with- that was until i finished the movie and realised how wonderful and necessary it was.

Finally not an over dramatisation of the Joker, showing the progression of insanity as human as possible.

Tied beautifully into the Bruce Wayne story without making him the central point.

And the ending was captivating and kept me in a trance like state, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I honestly was smiling like a maniac as the final scenes unfolded because it was perfect and long overdue after going through the mental battle with the Joker.

I can see how some can dislike it, but coming from a Marvel fan, this is one of the best movies i've ever watched and DC villains always go above and beyond Marvel ones."
919,"This isn't a super hero movie more like a physiological thriller. Watch a mans mental state shatter breaking the fabric of the real world. Excellent cinematography and music design. The rich eat the poor and the poor eat the rich. I just hoped it would provide more meaning than just anarchy, but that's what you get when society has a stroke.

Comparisons to the Comedian are over hyped but clearly there."
920,"I waited for a long time to see this movie.

I wanted for hype to die off and to see if the movie will endure the test of time. Well, pandemic was as good excuse as any for us to binge watch the movies in safety of our homes but I still didn't want to see it.

Until tonight.

Here's the thing - I've seen Jack Nicholson's Jack Napier tonight. I've seen Heath Ledger's Joker tonight. But I've only seen one movie and one actor. Joaquin Phoenix was BRILLIANT in the role of Joker, encompassing all the best from his predecessors and adding a twist or two of his own. Masterful performance that will be hard to surpass.

And as I said, I feel sorry for Jared Leto if he ever had to play Joker again. After Joaquin Phoenix' performance in this movie, Leto would be doing a career suicide to repeat his performance (and look) as a Joker from the first Suicide Squad movie.

On a final note, pure 10/10 for the director. I've rarely enjoyed cinematography as much as I did in this masterpiece. Kudos to all and a huge thank you for giving us this beatiful jewel."
921,"The acting, the music, the cinematography, the themes - I could gush for hours about the sheer amount of breath taking QUALITY in this film. If you like good cinema you will like this.

""Joker"" stands as one of the most left wing films I have ever seen that persuasively validates left wing theory, which is funny because they are the ones attacking it without having seen it! Cancel culture is stupid isn't it?

I felt the crushing weight and pressure of a cold society that did not care about the working class and that favored the elite. I saw a lonely human being kicked until he decided enough was enough and that resistance was not only the best way, but the only way forward.

I never felt more revved up to ""fight the power"" and give the middle finger to a corrupt system than after seeing the Joker!

The movie doesn't glorify shootings or vigilante justice so much as it makes it clear that if you take away options for people and treat them like they don't matter and don't exist then rebellion and riots WILL HAPPEN. It isn't so much a threat as an inevitability. People need to feel like the game isn't rigged against them to want to play.

The way to fix society is to reach out to others more, to be more kind, and to fix the broken corrupt system that lacks humanity and only cares about money.

The Joker is a hero for those who society deems garbage and worthless. In the movie there is a protester holding a sign that symbolizes modern-day society and it's connection to this movie perfectly: We are all clowns."
923,Phoenix provides the best acting ever. It's not the movie of the it's the movie of the DECADE.
924,"It´s ok if they wanted to give this movie an Scorsese´s Taxi-Driver vibe, but was too obvious at times... At the same time, I think the Joker deserved a better Origin story...but I hate Origin stories with some characters as Marvel´s Wolverine or DC´s Joker,so...I never liked the classic comic-book The Killing Joke for the same reason, so maybe I´m not the most objective. The 7 points I give this movie are because Phoenix, he is the dude who looks more like the Joker I ever seen, if he wasn't in this movie, it would have been less points.."
925,"Masterpiece? Are you Jokering me? Mediocre at best. The only explanation I can come up with to explain the gushing praise of this boring film is the dumbing down of a generation by the education system and PC culture. People seem to think its some kind of brilliant social commentary. I usually like Joaquin Phoenix, but here he plays a bland character who comes across as very dull and of low intelligence. His laugh is grating and very un-Joker like, his dialogue is stilted and uncomfortable. There is no wit, no clever dark comedy, just seriousness and depression. The Joker has always been portayed as crazy and mentally unbalanced, but never dim-witted, until now. I don't know why this character is even called the Joker. Other than having the name Arthur Fleck he seems to be an entirely different character. Its a depressing film, which is not a bad thing in and of itself, but in this case it is. Thankfully I didn't pay any money to see this one. I'm giving it one star to even out the ridiculously high rating its got. Otherwise I'd probably give it a 4"
926,"A truly stunning and surprising film. I went in with pretty low expectations and I was honestly shocked Todd Phillips made this. Joaquin Phoenix nails this performance and cemented himself as perhaps the second best Joker ever. It's just a genuinely incredible performance. I love the cinematography, set design and music. The film just oozes with character and panache. It's a slow burn, but well worth it. My only issues is that it didn't know where to quite end and some of the political commentary was a little hamfisted. But if I leave a Joker movie a little disturbed as to how some among us may interpret the message...I have to say, that's a successful Joker movie."
927,"Im not a Batman fan, actually I didn't even see The Dark Knight. I just went to see this movie because my wife wanted to go out... But after a couple of minutes I was totally in, glued to the chair and eating that masterpiece with all my senses. Acting, PHOTOS, music just WOW! Unbelievable climate, colors ... Just go to the cinema, you don't want to see that at home."
929,"It's just awesome. I loved Birdman and Black Swan cos of the descent into insanity themes but this just blows them out of the water. It's hard to say much without spoilers, if you've any interest in Batman you won't be disappointed. I have huge respect for Heath Ledger in Dark Knight and Mr Phoenix does him major justice as a prequel. Even the soundtrack is great, best comic based film I've seen in ages."
931,"This movie is hands down the greatest movie in the superhero/villian genre. The movie is not like all the other unoriginal and tiring stories of super powers and tons of action and bad guys trying to destroy the world, this much more and better. The movie follows Arthur Fleck and his descent into insanity and his eventual breaking point in his miserable life full of pain and hurtful truths. The movie is a psychological journey and is very entertaining and you start to begin to understand the joker and sympathize for him. This movie is truly the greatest movie in the genre and definitely worth the watch. (I also recommend the movie ""Taxi Driver"" if you enjoyed this movie. Another psychological masterpiece.)"
932,"If watching this film was a game of chess, you'd be playing against an opponent who won the game before it even started. No matter how you defend your king, your opponent outmaneuvers you and penetrates your emotional defenses every step of the way. Other directors should take notes because this is character study drama at its finest.

While some will say it moved too slowly, I personally feel it was paced perfectly given the content; a slow-bleeding, 'death by a thousand cuts' delivery, which gradually ramps up over the course of the entire film. The juxtaposition of humor and despair had my emotions on a tilt-a-whirl throughout, and was accompanied by a soundtrack that complemented the themes very well.

I highly recommend watching this one at least once, but steel yourself because it packs quite a punch."
933,"The acting by Joaquin Phoenix is without any doubt Oscar worthy and he carries the entire film. The story does a wonderful job of describing in too much detail the slow torturous descent of a slightly crazy young man into a full blown lost crazy man without meds. And the back story is well written with some nice twists that few comic stories make the viewer feel like this could be any person in any city that could suddenly turn crazy without their meds.

But besides the obvious fall from grace and tragic events that lead to his downfall it is a far cry from making one feel like this Joker is going to turn into the future Joker that is a genius manipulator and Gotham city nemesis to Batman, etc. You almost wish the film went a bit longer to see how the Joker genius ignites. It is almost like his character by luck or chance stumbles upon some ideas and then out of the blue.... the entire city is already rioting and tearing the place to pieces... and the Joker is just a sliver of influence. Not the master manipulator and he looks shocked it happens.

Maybe that is the entire point... that the inequality and injustice is so out of control deep inside the city that it only took a few crazy acts from the Joker to ignite that flame into a giant riot. Makes one think twice about what is going on in HKong and Iraq and what city will be next.

It is a film that makes one think about many aspects of life and character studies but the depth of showing why this all cascades into mayhem is barely touched upon... trite things like garbage strike, super rats, even the 1% wealthy and Mr Wayne are portrayed in a vague manner that lacks any reason for riots. And it does not have the entertaining comic book depth that one expects from a character like the Joker of the future... this guy is milk toast that might one day percolate into the genius maniac Heather/Nicholson Joker - but it felt more like a thriller character development story and less of a DC icon yet still an enjoyable film. Kudos to Phillips for taking a chance on making a gritty film even if references are stolen from Clockwork Orange, Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, etc. This might be a good prelude to a sequel that shows the transition to Joker genius Joker 2 and Joker 3 like the Hang Over trilogy. I sure hope not!!

A 7 mostly for the acting but not a 10 like some claim on here which is a bit excessive. It is no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination."
934,"Joker is without a doubt my new favorite DC film. It's dark and gritty but with enough psychological twists that it keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Nothing can be taken at face value and the film forces you to think from beginning to end. Don't listen to the critics, this one is worth watching multiple times in theaters."
935,"I am more disappointed at the build-up of this film than I am impressed with it-and it WAS good...but....no...not as good as other films out there.

Joaquin Phoenix remains under-rated and under-challenged.

The subject matter was relevant and timely...though not accompanied by any breakthrough insights or original observations. The OVER-lying comic-strip character story-line was somewhat interesting for a bit... Otherwise...Joaquin Phoenix lost 52 pounds and like Mathew McConaughey, might sell enough tickets to get an Oscar.

Woo. Hoo."
936,"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible."
938,"Powerful character study and portrayal. Strong screenplay. Excellent cinematography, score, and lead performance. Tight pacing. Well directed and focused narrative."
939,I expected little with it being attached to DC. I was wrong and wrong again. This the best 'origin story' movie I've ever seen. The movie did a good job of following his descent into madness and gave him sympathy. Of course some folks will not like this but to me it makes the character complete. Total hate for the Joker would make him one dimensional and that would be typical DC. Hey Heather! This ain't that movie
940,"I'm mesmerised , overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of Joaquin's Acting. The best cinematic experience I hve had in a long time. So glad I watched this in theatre."
941,"First thing I'll say is, I am not a huge DC fan. The dark knight I found a good film however not as good as people make out, so I went into this movie thinking I'd enjoy it but not really talk about it, my god how I was wrong. This movie is an absolute masterpiece, the character development of the Joker is the best I've ever seen, and it had me on the edge of my seat at moments. Easily say this is in my top 3 favourite movies of all time and after my second watch (later tonight lol) I'll decide for good if it's the top spot, which it could well be

Treat yourself and watch it"
942,"An origins story you never knew you needed. An incredible performance Joaquin Phoenix holds it all together. If you have watched batman films you will know the basic plot. This film ties it up all beautifully and explores alot of themes. It becomes almost uncomftabley relatable at points. The film doesn't really go anywhere it just shows us a character. There are no big susprises but a few twist and turns. If your like me you will know where it going almost from the start. Plently of violence is thrown in but not as much as you might expect. There is plently going on here behind the gore, violence and chaos."
943,The acting is fantastic. And it is an overall good movie. But Todd Phillips writing/directing is derivative of Martin Scorsese films.
944,"Todd Phillip's Joker does not possess the dramatic arc of most films. The arc during which things grow worse and worse until one day something happens following which the situations improve. In fact anyone who knows anything about the Batman Joker character is already aware that a happy ending here would be impossible. This is, after all, a prequel to all future Batman encounters with the villainous Joker.

I liked this film a great deal. I was thoroughly absorbed. I found Jaoquin Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck to be as riveting as any I've seen on film. He evokes fear (of his character), he evokes sadness (for his character), he evokes joy (within his character). The site of him in Joker get-up, dancing down a long flight of steps, dancing lightly down a long flight of steps, just one of many examples of the actor's range, his talent, his absolute possession of the screen. It can be said that the viewer of this film might very well find himself / herself rooting for the villainous Arthur as he descends further into his villainous madness In fact there were reviewers who thought this reason enough to pan the film, to see it as 'dangerous', to see it as a political statement to be avoided. Nonsense. Absolute nonsense. There are factors which contribute to Arthur Fleck's fate. Some genetic. Others, not. Much like all of us. And I found it fascinating.

On the downside we have Robert De Niro's portrayal as talk-show-host hosting the mad Arthur Fleck. A cute turn on De Niro's playing the madman to Jerry Lewis' TV host in Scorcese's King of Comedy. I imagine the casting in this film was intended as an ironic twist on that Scorcese film.

Whatever the reason, it was a bad, very bad, decision. De Niro is truly horrible."
945,"PROS:

Joaquin Phoenix's Joker Is Going To Be Iconic

Todd Phillip's Masterful Directing (Yes I Mean That)

Solid Supporting Cast (Especially From Robert De Niro)

The Psychological Drama

Lawrence Sher's Gritty And Beautiful Cinematography

The Realistic Tone

Its Gets Really Creepy And Disturbing

Some Moments Of Humor

There Are Some Genuine Surprises

The Messages And Subtext Is Done Well

It Makes You Question What Was Real Or Not

The 1970's Homages (The Scorsese Influence Is Obvious But Well Done)

CONS:

NONE!!!

(SJWs are going to tear this movie apart for no reason)"
946,"The movie was all about Pheonix's acting.. which was really good. He deserved the Oscar. But, as a story it was quite boring. The story line didn't have much hold with the audience. Maybe people are raving about it because they are supposed to?? Same case as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood which was all about acting. If you didn't like both the movies then maybe you are not cool enough as per society... Just a thought!"
947,"In terms of production this film is on the A lost, however, I failed to draw any entertainment or value from this movie. Dont recommend it at all."
948,"As one of the better known comic book character villains, this film makes for an interesting alternate of an origin story compared to the multitudes of others about the Joker. Phoenix commits to the role playing a realistic mentally ill/traumatized socially isolated character. Inevitably the conclusion is known from the start, ergo becoming the Joker, but the journey was interesting nevertheless."
949,"Joker is a film I only want to watch the once.

JP gives one's of the finest performances you will ever see. But this still doesn't make me want to watch again.

Joker is just too moving for me. I worked for 25 years with the victims of serious abuse and watching Joker is too close to home for me.

Joker is amazing. The pain that JP conveys is too real and I've heard the real thing way too many times to watch again because I know the story too well."
950,Just go and watch Joaquin Phoenix deliver one of the best performances in the history of hollywood movies... He does justice to the legend of Heath 'Joker' Ledger... Sure deserves an Oscar for this one.
951,We liked it. Even if you don't like superheros you'll like it because we do not like superheros at all. The movie is good. Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix! A good watch enjoy we recommend it!
952,This movie is a study on mental illness. It brings awareness about problems in society. Not giving anything else away. You'd have to see it to believe it. Joaquin Phoenix exceeded my expectations. His Joker has surpassed Heath Ledger's version in my opinion.
953,"Joker will draw you into his madness and sociopathy that will make you question everything. Todd and Joaquin bring us a masterpiece of human nature and how person is shaped by events that are happening to them.

Joker is a dramatic piece that will be understood by regular people and seen in grey areas and not only black and white. It's about human tortures and dramatic events that happen all around us but we pretend like everything is fine. Joker dives deep into dark teritories and pushes boundaries with extreme violence but shows us why is everything happening and how our protagonist is dealing with information given to him. Arthur Fleck is a disturbed man which is evident from beginning but as story goes you find to learn more about him and how he is only trying to find its way in the crazy world.

There are multiple possibilites for someone if they pursue them, they might not be the best but Arthur chooses one that he feels most comfortable with and his sense of comedy and darkness is unique but who are we to put his hopes and dreams down. Joaquin's commitmend to role is extraordinary, he pushes boundaries with his dedication for characters place and feelings. It is absolutely magnificent to watch him present us Arthur in all his colors and shades as he is mesmerasing, deceving and twisted.

Todd moving from his regular comedy type movies and going full drama, choosing Joker (DC comics based character) and putting him in real world with real people insted of fictional universe is praise worth and him developing such a intriguing story that will feel like you are watching some regular drama inspired by time and day we live in. We live in sick and hard times but we choose to fight and overcome everything but there will always be other ones that are not capable of doing it and it will make them mad. Insted seeing this movie as movie that can make people do bad things it should make them see that bad things are not acceptable and how they make things dark and chaotic. and will always end in personal destruction.

Directing and writing of Joker is marvellous from every point, it may not be the smart as some movies but it is captivating and makes you wonder all the time how things are going to happen and how they might have happened. Todd may have started his new path into greater film making and it will be interesting to see what he has to offer in the upcoming years.

Dark, twisted and magnificent are the best words to describe the movie. 10/10"
955,"Synopsis: Arthur Fleck - a party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian, always finds life throwing sh!t at him. Already frustrated, his mental health worsens when the Govt stops funding his psychatric counselling & meds. How Arthur's personality devolves from a benign guy to a sociopath forms the rest of the plot.

Review: ""Joker"" is a multilayered film helmed by Todd Philips with an Oscar worthy turn by Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role. The film is so affecting, it stays with you long after the end credits roll. It would be unnecessary to compare Joaquin's Joker with Ledger's Oscar winning turn as the Joker, since the same character is written differently in both films, yet both the brilliant actors succeed in leaving their own impression on the viewer. The violence in this film has been overhyped by some critics, the film is more a character study/drama with only a few scenes of violence that are essential to show the characters' devolution. Those expecting an ""action"" film, are likely to be disappointed. Special mention for the ominous background score by Hildur Guðnadóttir.

Though this movie was planned as a standalone, I hope the success of this film inspires a Sequel. Well done, Todd Phillips & Co. Looking forward to see more from you.

My rating: 10/10."
957,"Yes Pheonix gives a great performance and yes it 'looks' kind of cool - that's all this film has to offer. Superficial, shallow and ultimately void of any substance.

The best way I can describe this film is, it's as if a first year film school student was given millions of dollars to have a go. The story does nothing to help you believe that this guy will one day be smart and dangerous enough to hurt Batman - and it MUST do that, it cannot just live in the vacuum of the Directors mind otherwise it's just a story about a weirdo. There has to be SOME respect paid to the canon. Next, the scenes set-ups and shot compositions were so contrived, the story progression was primtive and designed only to make the Joker seem like a pathetic loser that's clearly going to snap - when it happened it was no shock. Neither was it an insightful exploration of mental illness - it was more a cliche version of that rendered in crayons. The dialogue was basic and whilst the imagery was well executed it used very well worn themes of this genre. Totally overrated, a poor film. But audiences these days are easily duped what can I say..."
958,"Well, what can I say, most of the reviews are already saying it! This film is really strong & very deep into the character, Joaquin plays the part much better than Nicholson & Ledger in my opinion. I have always been an avid Batman fan growing up with Keaton back in 1989, loved Bales performance too. This however takes in a whole new approach following the Joker story. You will not be disappointed. I would definitely pay to see this all over again. 10/10"
959,"Not a super-hero movie. So if your not a fan of the corny costumes - don't worry. This feels very real and you don't need to know the backstory to understand what's happening.

If you are a fan of Bat-Man this definitely has some great references.

I can't believe I empathize with the joker!!

I wish the suicide squad and the Harley Quinn movie were more similar to this..

This film was done so well but definitely messes with your head (if you like that kinda thing)"
960,"Its a risky film. It may have turned disaster but it achieves the tag of critically acclaimed and a movie for the masses, for comic lovers at the same time. Watching this take on the origin of the greatest villian in comics ever was delightful, emotional, thought provoking and disturbing at the same time.. Joaquin was at his career best"
961,"I work in psychology, and the Joker is my favorite villain. As such, I have high standards and had high expectations after all the hype. This movie did not disappoint! The step-by-step plot creation and alignment was thorough and impressive. Joaquin was flawlessly cast and brilliantly performed."
962,"Wow, in the words of the song, I wasn't expecting that!

I thought it would be like Batman but there is nothing comic book about this!

I'm a mental health crisis nurse with 21 years experience and I'm sad to say that this is a true reflection of community care as a result of years of the Tory regime.

We used to have case study videos at Uni but this tops them all.

It is the perfect portrayal of a man with antisocial personality disorder who is consistently let down by the system and slips through the net with disastrous consequences.

Everything about this film is genius.

Mr Phoenix, words fail me, apart from he is one magnificently gifted individual. A breathtaking performance.

The film is very very dark, very very depressing but so gripping and engaging.

Ignore the hype about people walking out and the glorification of violence, it's nonsense. Watch the average horror movie and that will be much more bloody and violent than this and if anyone were to wear a clown's mask and try to copy then they are seriously in need of help.

Don't watch this if you're expecting a typical comic book film, but if you're after an adult, mature and true to life character depiction, then watch this.

Awesome."
964,"This movie is just brilliant. It came up to be one of the best films done in the decade. Its direction and photography are really pleasing and excellent. Joaquin Phoenix acting is spectacular. And it's a powerful competitor for the Best Actor in a Leading Role and the movie itself for the Best Picture award. When I saw this movie it remembered me a lot to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976) due to its cinematic references to the classic. It was definitely worth the money and time. And after years of a lot of superhero movies coming from Marvel Studios, this one comes (in my opinion) as a very needful type of movie these days. A serious, dark, with a bit of funny moments movie. To see Arthur Fleck A.K.A. Joker, (Joaquin Phoenix) transform from a relatively ""normal"" guy to a crazy, obscure man because of all the revelations and life problems he has to go through, is just, as mentioned before, brilliant. Also adding that the script, was written as a new origin for Batman's enemy, the direction and acting from Phoenix and that its final minutes are just excellent, makes this movie as named in the title, an authentic masterpiece."
965,"This movie has it all, ecxept the modern politics propaganda that destroys all movies nowdays.

I don't wan't to go in to much on what makes this movie so good i may do a longer rewiev later but for now, I just reccomend you to watch it before you make up your mind..

And rest in peace to all movies that have fell vicims on todays nonsense."
966,"""Every story needs its hero. And its villain. And its monster."" The Caped Crusader of Gotham City was never complete without his villain, the Joker. What made The Dark Knight (2008) a phenomenal success at the box office and as an all time cult classic was the characterization of the agent of chaos and seamless delivery of witful dialogues and challenges. It wasn't a surprise that the people loved the Joker more than the Batman himself in the film, for he, the Joker, didn't have any rules to play by. It was unfortunate that Heath Ledger had to leave this world, and thus creating a permanent vacuum in the Gotham City. There had been attempts by Jared Leto to fulfill the gap, but it is no match.

DC had to come up with a solo Joker movie that was due for long. Joaquin Phoenix had been creating the buzz ever since the first look poster arrived and looks-wise he was almost..almost matching the legend of Heath Ledger. With much expectations, the Joker is finally here.

Set in 1981, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a disregarded personality who works as a clown at places wherever needed and lives with his mom Penny. With a rare neurological condition, he suffers from frequent and inopportune laughter which irks people around him. The city as such is infested with crime and unemployment all over, hence there is no question of sympathy or concern for special characters such as him. Struggling to make a mark as a stand up comedian, Arthur also suffers from delusions where he is unable to distinguish reality from dreams. Things go topsy-turvy when one of his colleagues hands him over a gun to take care of miscreants who harm him. Arthur uses it against 3 rogue employees of Wayne Enterprises. While the cops are in search for Arthur, he also is in constant battle to come up as a comedian, pursue his neighborhood crush, find out the true identity of his father and take care of his mom. When he finds an answer to most of these, how he handles them and emerges as the Gotham City rebellion is the plot.

The movie has its high moments in the seamless change of expressions and body language of Joaquin. The audience will be in for a shock to see his shirtless episodes where he reminds one of Christian Bale from The Machinist (2004 The background score in most places takes the cue from The Dark Knight and builds over it to make us feel the connect. Also there are too many frames that resemble the ones of Heath Ledger, which possibly could be a deliberate attempt. ). For those expecting a Batman cameo in this movie - the answer is both YES and NO.

While this movie could easily be a grandeur in performances, one cannot get the rush that was given by the one played by Heath Ledger. Surely, there cannot be a comparison to the 2008 Joker version, for that set its standards too high that any more attempts can only keep trying to scale up half way. We can only hope the sequel to this one has much more interesting elements, for the movie ends with enough scope for that hope!"
967,"Before getting to the film proper I must say I think the score is quite good. It is hauntingly beautiful and wonderfully atmospheric. It is a shame that the music has to be associated with the resulting film. The score repeatedly ends up putting a shine of the film that it truly didn't earn. I greatly dislike the film but the score is one of the year's best.

Anyway, there are any number of films that take on this general material of the alienated white guy who snaps because of the (alleged) mistreatment by society he receives. Just going from memory you have Taxi Driver (the film lifts the journal concept from it), King of Comedy (the film lifts the obsession with the comic from it), Falling Down (the exaggerated violence) and One Hour Photo (heavy handed symbolism). Joker most closely follows King of Comedy but it is a slew of all of these films. Quite frankly I don't think there is an original concept in the entire film. It all would be pitiable if such an aesthetic deserved pity.

Worse the film's overall structure just lends itself to tedium. Fleck is an unreliable narrator-any number of scenes occur within his psyche and much of the film you see is narrative untrustworthy. I am sure there is a clear tell between reality and Fleck's delusions (clocks always have the same time by way of example) Whatever the solution is I don't think it matters. You still dealing with a warmed over re-hash of white men feeling left behind by society changing. It is either a projection of theirs (which it is) or society doesn't care about white male pain. (laughable) Regardless, the extra work you need to do to put the narrative in proper context isn't worth it. Traditionally, the Joker's origins are unknown and I think the film raises the distinct possibility that Fleck isn't really the Joker. The film feels like it goes nowhere.

This emptiness is best captured by the only provocative moment in the entire film. For plot reasons I need not get into Fleck ends up in the Joker make-up *and* wearing a Joker mask. So a joker face is behind a joker mask. This mask-within-a-mask moment is central as the implication that Joker-ness is merely masks all the way down is too forceful to ignore. But if it is just masks all the way down the film is utterly unsatisfactory. The solution in the origin story film cannot be there is no solution. In any case, any number of scenes of Fleck being weird and edgy simply drag.

I suspect I am rather cool to the overall picture because I don't particularly like Phoenix's performance. It is one of those engaging but bad performances that people mistake for great acting. It is not going to age well. Whether it is the laughing-while-sobbing moments or the ponderous delivery of the overwrought lines Phoenix is working much too hard. The performance is all flash and much like the film it is constructed out of far better work.. There is a bit of Crispin Glover here. There is some Travis Brickle. Ledger's Joker was clearly studied. And so on.

It is simply perplexing that this film is making any waves at all in the award season."
969,"Its a master piece of Oscar goes to Joaquin Phoenix, No doubt he deserves an Oscar for acting. What an amazing movie, We can see many faces of Arthur fleck. You can see cry, laugh, Pain, in this movie. Amazing performance by Phoenix. A must watch movie in a life time."
970,"I get it. You're watching this movie thinking, ""What's the point?"" ""Everyone treats him terribly, is that really justification for what he becomes?"" ""Why is everyone a jerk and he's seen as an anti-hero?"" All those questions are valid. Here's my perspective.

Firstly, watch the movie on your own. Pay attention to the detail. To every word, every scene, even the clothes, the extras, the background, etc. This is important. Why?

Because this is not just a movie ""about"" the Joker. This is a movie FROM the Joker.

He isn't the focus of the movie - you are. The movie is him telling his side of the story. And why is that important?

Because you need to ask yourself, what is a more accurate depiction of someone's life? An objective, third person view? Or someone telling you why they did write they did?

Without giving the game away, keep this in mind. The movie is called Joker. It's not just his name, it's what he is doing to you - the viewer. And that's the beauty of this movie. His name is A. Fleck. As in Affleck. That's a giveaway right there that it's not intended to be a factual account of Joker's life. His story is wrapped in lies, in misdirection, in making you think he's a good bad guy but in fact he's just a terrible human. The movie is Joker giving you a story, getting you to 'understand' him, and then him laughing in your face for taking and of that in.

No, it's not your normal movie. If you want an A-B-C storyline, you won't like this. If you want an origin story, you won't get this. But if you just want to watch something without any preconceptions, without any judgement, then just watch it and dive into his mind. Because you are his audience."
974,"The best thing about the movie is, without question, the performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His grounded, sympathetic, and eerie take on the character will (and should) be celebrated and talked about for many years.

That said...if you can imagine the movie without Phoenix's gravitas, you will notice that the rest of the film is pretty standard stuff. The cinematography is definitely great, and the director definitely knows how to speak in the language of film. And yet, there's a strange ""safe-ness"" to everything. Nothing gets too shocking- nothing gets too out of hand. Even the dialogue is surprisingly low-key and minimalist.

Compared to the films (and comics) that inspired this film, it starts to feel like a love-letter to other, more edgy, material. If you've seen Taxi Driver, or Death Wish, or read The Killing Joke, or The Dark Knight Returns, you will find lots of nods and similarities. It's all blended quite well, actually, but at the cost of feeling a bit predictable. As with any origin story, you already know the ending before the film begins.

In the end, though, I'd still recommend seeing it if you liked the trailer. You can't deny that the film is doing something new and enticing in the DC universe. I'd happily see a sequel to this film, continuing where it left off. I just wish they put more effort into making the film stand out a bit more from the material that inspired it, not just to rely on the lead actor to carry all the weight."
975,Great story and masterful performance by Joaquin phoenix.
977,"You have to be patient with Todd Phillip's Joker before he delivers the requisite gore fest this god of sadistic comedy requires. It is carried along most of the way by the outstanding performance of Joaquin Phoenix and a lax system and gullible society unable to put the obvious together that allows the morose Arthur Fleck to wreak havoc in plain sight.

Nothing could live up to the film's hype and outside of Phoenix's stirring but admittedly overlong performance ( a little too many yoga poses) the film depends heavily on nostalgia (music, era, Scosese) to propel its meagre satiric moments. As far as the character, Peck is classic cliche loner, Travis Bickle as Paglacci hanging around his old haunts.

Like all hateful Jokers, Arthur is imbued with the ability to take an incredible beating as he does here before rising from the ashes in Todd's apocalyptic uptown climax that is more nonsensical than parable.

Featuring a performance for the ages Joker ultimately is a smug gratuitously violent slasher, its unintentionally comic moments watching the heavy handed Phillips maintain PC order amid all the chaos."
978,"Joaquin phoenix perfect, like all the jokers. The classic story is told differently. A very familiar and very different story. Everyone should watch"
979,"So I've seen Joker at the theater twice now. I've been holding off making a review as this film just has so many spinning wheels to process. I will say, I completely understand why someone would not enjoy Joker. It's dark, disturbing, and hits way to close to home with our current social political system. That being said I love the film! I absolutely think it is a work of art and easily the best DC film to date.

Anyone familiar with the joker origin story from The Killing Joke knows the Joker is an unreliable narrator. This tradition continues in this Joker origin story that is so outside the traditional genre it's hard to even call it a comic book film. Arthur Fleck is a struggling clown for hire attempting to live his dream of being a comedian. All the while he is forced to live with a rare neurological disorder that makes him laugh uncomfortably and suffers from extreme depression and anxiety. As the film unfolds we witness the slow falling apart of a man pushed to the brink of madness and what happens when society as a whole gives up on him and falls apart.

Joker certainly owes quite a bit of its storytelling to Scorsese with strong themes coming from both Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Here we examine a case study of a man feeling alienated and alone all the while examining quite a bit of social commentary on some of the darker side of our society. The film exams so many real issues like the failures in mental health, class conflict, social alienation, and the political system it's hard not to feel uncomfortable while watching a film that both reflects and distort reality to make a dark and entertaining film that will leave a lasting impression.

I also have to say how much I enjoyed the overall director's choices made in the film. Despite the overall length I didn't have an issue with the pacing at all. I was on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next as the film constantly inched the tension forward as you wait for Joker to explode. The dialogue was sharp and somehow manage to be both funny and psychologically jarring at the same time. The film had so many moments that made you want to cry with just how dark the content was, but also threw in intense scenes to add elements of horror and suspense all the while having a few genuinely laugh out loud moments.

The screenwriting was so all over the place but in a absolutely fantastic way. It is hard not to compare the film to Scorsese and so many flattering ways. I must also mention how great the score was for the film. Both haunting and memorable and worked incredibly well with the gritty realistic setting of the film. On top of that the film has many moments that are open to interpretation and will leave many with a completely different viewing experience. Joker will stay with you for days at a time and is an absolutely perfect movie to try and dissect the hidden subtext of a movie that is trying to say so much about our society.

With all that being said even if this film was terrible it would be a must-see entirely for Joaquin Phoenix's performance. He is an absolutely phenomenal actor and one of the best of his generation at throwing himself at a role. That being said this may be a career best. His performance was absolutely amazing and was on a level few actors can reach. Not only did he physically transform himself completely, but every aspect of his persona melted into becoming the Joker. The laugh was so perfect, but more so it was his depiction of the character's psychological trauma that really made a stunning performance. If he does not get recognition from the Oscars the system is truly broken.

So I loved Joker. Still no film is perfect and Joker is no exception. Anyone looking for any semblance of a DC comic book film will be disappointed. There is almost zero mythos from the comics left intact in this film. The film could have been completely unrelated to DC and it only would have changed a few cameo appearances. On top of that while I enjoyed the pacing there were a few scenes that could have been omitted to shorten the time of the film. There is also the question of should this movie exist in the first place? It's constantly bleak and depressing that some may left feeling sickened instead of entertained. This may not be the film we need with so much darkness in our world, but it just may be the film we deserve. If you can push past the knee-jerk reaction to feel disgusted the film is truly a unique experience.

Joker was my most anticipated film of the year. For me it was an utter masterpiece that demands to be seen. The film takes a refreshingly unorthodox look at the Joker character but also applies some truly stunning social commentary to make the film relevant. On top of that the acting and screenwriting were phenomenal and easily some of the best of 2019. Joker is certainly not a film for everyone. That being said it is one of my favorites for 2019 and is sure to go down as one of the greatest comic book adaptations of all time. A 9.5 out of 10."
982,Very nice in my opinion it is the best story about the joker
983,"It would take me hours to describe my feelings for this movie.

I went to the cinema expecting to see a great performance from Phoenix...but...it wasnt just him....Everything was great the story the music the photography directing...Phoenix will win the oscar (im sorry for the rest of the contestants)..

Everything is just WOW about him ...what a great movie ...

Just a reminder to Hollywood that a great script with a great acting has no need of special effects or cgi or action scenes or whatever to make the top...Go back to movies like that ..make sure the story is good and the acting is good and forget about the rest

Congraz to everyone for that masterpiece...and we the viewers thank you!"
984,I loved the acting but movie is Overhyped. Story is not upto the mark . They should have sticked to the original comic book origin of the joker instead of this . I have a seven just for the acting of Joaquin he is the only reason movie is a little good.
985,"Put on a happy face

Whaaaaaat, this movie is just blowing mind! It's just perfect the evolution of the Joker and how they become what he is, how all the things conspire to go wrong in your life, and not just the character is amazingly explored, the photography, the color palette, the plot, direction, everything wonderful! I just think that the beginning was pretty slowly, but when the joker start to act it's just perfect, the violence, the madness. Joaquin Phoenix crush it all."
986,"I want to start by saying Joaquin's performance is outstanding and if he receives the oscar for best actor I would say that it's justified. This movie however is not the masterpiece many people are claiming it to be. Where a lot of people praise it for going where no other movie has gone before, I feel it didn't go far enough. There are some disturbing moments but they are all highly predictable. And as a film which is basically about a guy who falls deeper and deeper into mental illness it is too pretty and polished for me. I wanted to be surprised, I wanted to be shocked, I wanted to be disgusted, but I wasn't. The acting saves it and if it wasn't for the excellent performances by Phoenix, De Niro and Conroy, the score wouldn't even be a 7 for me."
987,Well someone said Roma was boring wait till you see this overrated mess.
988,"This is my fav movie of 2019, i am sure most of you heard this is not your typical comic book action flick so don't go expecting tons of action, if you do then i am sorry to say this movie is probably not for you. (i would've gave it a 10/10, but it took lots of inspiration from taxi driver.) so i had to give it an 8/10. Still a great movie imo."
989,"Wow! The problems of real world and how they darken our souls.

Some of the problems he was dealing with hit very close to home and I can easily understand the rage each of us can feel when confronted with society's hierarchy and how some of us are treated like we're disposable. When that rage is combined with mental illness, it ignites a flame in this movie.

This movie also creates a very believable origin story for the Joker. Very good. Go and see it."
990,"Dear movie freaks, Joker is the most anticipated movie that we have been expecting since the first month of year 2019 and yes this is a very good dramatic movie. I said dramatic because Joker delivers us the ideas on how Arthur Fleck character can be Joker, right when we totally forgot about Batman appearance. We don't care about Batman here. We care about a joker, a comedian, a broken child, and a really sad story of a man who sacrifices everything to be happy, yet we never really understand what is going on his mind and heart, until we saw the killings and the blood and we blame him as a villain. I really salute the Director, the make up team, editor, cinematographer, scriptwriter, and Joacquin Phoenix acting, wow he could win Oscar for this movie. This movie has few actions, but a lot of tears and drama and how we can reflect to ourselves, are we really happy or just a made-up-happy just to make our life comfortable....2 hours are not enough to understand Joker but I really love the ending that you can't watch without clapping your hands. A Masterpiece!"
991,"Joker is a character study about an insane person. It's not a comic book movie, it's not trying to be. Todd Phillips, who directed the Hangover movies, rose to the occasion here and made a solid origin story about the Joker. However, it's Joaquin Phoenix who makes it memorable and great.

The script has flaws, the biggest one being the lack of subtlety in the first half of the movie. I know it's not supposed to be subtle, but the way things constantly go wrong for Arthur - he gets beat up, he loses his job, he gets humiliated - is handled so clumsily.

There are a couple of shocking moments. There's a reason this gets compared to Taxi Driver. It's a little clunky at first, but things come together wonderfully in the last act. It's nice to see a movie from the villain's perspective for a change. Things are looking up for DC."
992,"Joker is a near two hour, dark, somber, cinematic masterpiece, where we witness the origin of the greatest Batman villains of all time, and understand in great depth, what made him what he is. We can see why Phoenix won the Academy Award, as this great actor has done such a great volume of work, and this is his movie to shine. He does so much with his character, a brave acting feat. The movie too, plays Jokes on you, as you'll see. Granted, Joker is dark, but is just totally engrossing from start to finish, no matter where you watch it. We praise the joker's murderous actions too. De Niro as a scummy t.v. show host isn't shown enough, and we almost forget him, as being so engaged with Phoenix's brilliant take on the super villain. Joker is a deep character study, of alienation, humiliation, twisted imaginings, rejection, all those negatives. He isa truly tortured soul, his family history only amplifying that torture. The music is eerily terrific, and we so feel for poor old Arthur Fleck. The dark piece, had me laughing a few times, at some lines, and Phoenix's laugh though a trifle annoying, you wanna hear more. Way more than any other movie, this is one that demands your attention. No joke."
993,"A masterpiece. Mr Phoenix what a performance . A man pushing down by the society. Stand for himself a last and defend the negative people around him. I must say very realistic,also I feel sorry about that neighbor girl . I was hoping a least this went well,but that's was only his imagination. Such a shame... great escape from reality"
994,"Phoenix 100% deserves his Oscar because he sold the movie. No other actor could have made the mediocre plot into a somewhat decent piece of work. The climax was definitely unexpected. This version of the Joker is more believable than Ledger's but Ledger's is just overall more unhinged, terrifying, and mesmerizing. Back to Joaquin. I don't know how someone so consistently shines in every role they're cast as. I watched this movie three times, and each time you notice small ticks and sporadic actions Joaquin inserted into the scenes to create an indelible mark on the character by the end of the movie we come to call the Joker."
995,"I have so many thoughts on this film and it truly does take you to places most films wouldn't dare. It takes its time in developing a truly dark, brooding atmosphere and fleshes out the full extent it can take to truly push one to the edge. And those last twenty minutes or so... just speechless. Loved the direction by Phillips, the music, the homage to older Hollywood filmmaking and the brilliantly engrossing character study. Bravo Joaquin - I, and it seems like many people here on IMDb, will surely be rooting for you come Oscar season. It truly feels like his entire career has led to this moment - undoubtedly a performance for the ages!"
997,"The story doesn't work for this character and this character doesn't work for this movie.

It's quite insulting the prestige this movie is gaining even though it's so poorly planned out. It wants to milk the ""Joker"" name and fan base to please teenagers and fanboys while trying to do a new Taxi Driver and/or The King of Comedy (straight up copying-pasting so many elements!). And trying to go both ways doesn't work.

The excessive amount of overexplaining and overacting is annoying and exhausting. We get it! The guy's crazy! People are mean to him! Joaquin Phoenix lost a lot of weight! None of it serves the story!

Overall is an ok movie but a waste of a decent story on a comic book character that doesn't fit in it."
998,"""Joker"" doesn't wait long to begin inflicting harm.

In the opening scene, we watch Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) stare into a mirror as he pulls up the corners of his mouth, forcing a smile. It's an early indication of the unhappiness that has brewed inside Arthur all his life. It's also an early indication of the unhappiness we're about to endure for next two hours.

""Joker"" is a miserable watch. It's endlessly depressing, containing not a single ounce of happiness, humor or hope. Arthur's daily existence as a struggling performing clown consists of nothing but loneliness and grim thoughts, much like what I felt during my time in the theater. It is a burden to sit through this movie.

The never-ending cavalcade of sadness and loathsome behavior we witness on screen does not contain nearly enough depth to be worthy of the debate that raged for months in advance of the premiere. The movie is flat out bad. It's derivative of better movies (namely, Taxi Driver & The King of Comedy), unnecessarily violent, and annoyingly over-the-top. But the movie's greatest flaw is that is boring.

Nothing interesting or unexpected occurs. Some of the events could have passed for interesting if they had not been painstakingly foreshadowed by the previous hour of mundane bleakness.

Every scene essentially delivers the same message: Arthur lives in a world of poverty, torment, and loneliness. Arthur is lonely at work, on the bus, in the elevator, while watching tv - every scene tells the same story. Watching the string of scenes one after another quickly grows tired and dull. It's all painfully repetitive and frustratingly one note. The presence one scene depicting an auspicious event, any reason for hope or happiness would have given a much welcome break from the monotonous misery.

Sadly, that break in tone arrives in the form of explosive bursts of violence. Lost on no one is the fact that Arthur has a mental illness, which undoubtedly contributes to his violent fits of rage - this sends the message to viewers that these sorts of people are dangerous and frightening. It's a reckless and problematic depiction of a person suffering from mental illness, one that only serves to perpetuate an already damaging stigma.

Any earnest exploration carried out by the movie into the lack of help provided to individuals with mental illness was too superficial to make a real impact. A potential tagline for the movie ""Society created the Joker"" has about as much depth as the movie itself. Sure, that idea is lightly implied, but it's not unpacked in any meaningful way during the two-hour runtime.

Any social issues aside, the main reason I didn't enjoy the movie is because it's simply not a good movie. All reports suggest that this movie is a one off and will have no sequels. I can only hope that's true.

I suggest finding something else to watch, like one of the many superior films available in theaters or via streaming. If you don't, the joke is on you."
999,"The title says it all, that is the message I got from this movie after walking out of it. This movie, is the most realistic comic book movie ever made. It is so powerful, and so well made that at times I forgot I was even watching a movie. It was engaging, terrifying, and will probably give you anxiety by the end of it. As you follow Arthur throughout the movie, this is the type of movie that makes you hate society and the rich people who look down on everyone else in the world. Critics are giving this movie bad reviews because they are jumping on the media bandwagon, of believing that this movie is going to spark violance, without even praising the movie for being a movie. It is one of the best acted filmsI have ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the decade as Arthur Fleck/Joker. His performance is so powerful, so realistic, that you could swear the character was real. I loved how in the beginning of the film, you see Arthur as this broken down man, who is ignored, and abused by everyone, to the legend that will be known as Joker. There hasn't been an actor to potray a psychotic character so convincing since Jack Nicholson from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (another actor who was brilliant as the Joker). Even the supporting cast all did brilliantly, from De Niro, to Frances Conroy, everyone in this movie gives amazing performances.

This movie is beyond its time, I guarentee,if this movie had been made in the 70s-80s, it would be considered one of the greatest movies ever made. Everything about it screams classic. From the brilliant directing style from Todd Phillips, from the outstanding cinematography, and the heart-pounding soundtrack. There is nothing about this movie that has problems. Some may be a little turned off by it, they may find it disturbing, because of how real it feels, but you can't deny how well made this film it. The same guy who directed the Hangover movies made this ..... let that sink in. One of the best scenes in the entire movie, and I will not spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but there is a scene where Arthur is being spoken to, and the camera focuses on Arthur's face. It doesn't cut away, it slowly zooms in, and showed the powerful jawdropping performance by Joaquin. He didn't even say a word, yet his expression told a thousand words. It was at that moment, I knew this movie was going to be special.

Now I know most people are going to compare Joaquin's joker, with the legendary Heath Ledger, and I don't want to compare them, since they are so different, yet similar. They both carry their own movies, and this is certainly the best film to feature the joker character since the Dark Knight, but this movie is much more personal than that movie.

There isn't much that could be said about this film without spoiling it, but it is brilliant, and ignore any critic reviews you read, because they are all in the pockets of the ones who want to shut movies like this down. They don't care about issues like mental illness, portayed like this. They would rather see a man in a dress, and call it art. This movie is real art, it is extrodanry, and films like this come once in a life-time. I really hope we see more of Joaquin in the future, since he isn't a sequel type of guy. I really hope they make future movies, based in this universe, and doesn't make them lose their touch. Just imagine a Lex Luthor film made by these guys? Or Riddler, hell, even Penguin. But I do believe that we will see this Joker again, even more so since Matt Reeves is making a Batman movie. And people who are familar with his work, understand that he makes very real, very grounded movies, and his style would only fit a superhero universe like this one. Fingers crossed people!

9.5/10... Masterpiece - ""I hope my death makes more cents than my life."" Best unspoken movie quoet ever."
1000,Phoenix is versatile actor I am following him from gladiator from that to joker he has done various characters but this is his career best I think I don't know how to praise this film this movie is masterpiece. That's the only thing I can say
1001,"A dark, terrifying, brilliant, deeply disturbing and unforgettable movie with gorgeous visuals. The cinematography is bold and the performance from Joaquin Phoenix is truly captivating as Joker. I feel like Joaquin should get an Oscar nomination out of this, if not the win. The psychological journey of Arthur Fleck is interesting -especially for Criminology students- as Fleck's descent into madness and self-discovery as a villain is aggressive in its unpleasantness. The ""Hangover"" director Todd Phillips won the challenge of making ""Joker"" and it works not only because it's completely different to the average comic book movie, but also because it's an impeccably acted and directed drama. nikisreviews.gr"
1003,"This is not a really good Movie.

This Movie is whatever people can say, when they so not find words after seeing it.

2hrs with a Villain ......

I wont Spoil this great experience. I would be the Villain If I would do.

Thank you Todd Phillips."
1004,"First let me start by saying that this film is absolutely award season material. The tone, music, story and jaw dropping performance by Phoenix should be seen by anyone who is a fan of film. Having said that, this is one of the darkest films I have ever seen. There is little to grab onto for anyone who is an optimist or likes neat happy stories. It's a difficult watch, that for the excellent story and performance by Joakim Phoenix would have many not lasting until the final credits. I'm so glad I saw this movie, would certainly recommend this movie but i felt upon leaving the theater that I needed to wash my brain and would not view it again for a good long while."
1005,"Great imitation of '70s era Scorsese. From colors to performances to music cues. But ultimately who needed a Joker prequel movie? And why with this much style? It's sad how Americas best filmmakers are stuck making comic book movies, but clearly it's benefiting the quality of said movies."
1006,"I usually write reviews on amazing movie experiences or if my perception of the movie is the opposite of the so called critics.

This time is both!

I don't think I need to point out anything for Joaquin's performance, Oscar worthy, brilliant, at the same level as Heath, even though the comparison is really inglorious, since this is a standalone movie

Now for the movie itself, above all, I believe it conveys a really strong message which most of us would like to ignore, which is the suffering and complications with intense mental disorders. I am not an American national, but I've been there several times, and I strongly believe that not only, there is still a heavy stereotype for this individuals, but also, given the current social/economic reality, not enough has been done for those who carry this traumas.

And while the movie explores this, it doesn't compromise the infamous villain story, it actually brings a wider perspective on his motives and behavior, and how he reached the downward spiral we all witnessed in the Dark Knight

I am also not a fan of a specific component of the story line, which they used to cause more impact, I won't spoil it, let's just say they could have used any other character to convey the exact same message.

Aside from that, overall it's an intense, dark, bold movie, which contrary to critics mention of bringing nothing new, it actually does. No it's not a ripoff of Taxi Driver, inspired? Maybe, but if you indeed compare it, I actually believe Joker provides even more in depth to the psychology of the character as well as way more context.

It's not subtil, and it doesn't need to be"
1007,"I enjoyed the movie it has a grittiness and indeed the acting is top notch. My problem is the story. Though the story of how the Joker becomes the Joker it doesn't do much else. I would expect the story to contain something more, some great lines, memorable moments something to keep the tension heightened but it doesn't. Yes it's well acted, and one of my friends tried comparing it to Taxi Driver but coming out of the movie I asked him to provide me one memorable quote/line and he couldn't (I can provide you several for Taxi Driver that I watched over 20 years ago). So yeah it's a good movie and worth seeing but don't expect a lot to happen, and definitely it's no masterpiece. I gave it a solid 7."
1009,"Mind-blowing masterpiece! What a performance... Pure art in movie theatre. I'm speachless!!! I'll definitely go and watch again. Brilliantly performed! We all have been alone at some point of time in life, think about those who've been nobody forever. Brilliant - one word. MASTERPIECE 🤡"
1010,"Not a movie type I like. It's give way too much negative energy that I can't take it but it's had a special magic that will lure you to see this wonderful act again. can feel pain,helpless, sadness in his laughter that bring u chill in every part of your bones.It's send a powerful message that Everyone can become a joker if the environment betray and don't accept them. the world will be a better place if we shown some love and patience to those have trouble expressing themself. I totally love this movie."
1011,"People often judge movies harshly when they receive the amount of press prior to the release as the Joker did. I heard statements like ""Don't believe the hype!"" and ""Don't drink the Kool aid!"" Well all I have to say is ""Chug this Metiphorical Kool aid!"" This movie blew me away. The acting was to damn good to put into words. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing and I predict he will be leaving with a Oscar this year. If he doesn't win then I am calling Bull Shizer."
1012,"To say the movie is just emotionally potent is putting it mildly. Some scenes are absolutely unsettling. Let's just say this is not a film you can watch with the family - (18+) for a reason. It is scary how strongly it will affect people who have felt isolated and alone. I know for myself, it hit close to home. Honestly, you shouldn't watch it with people you don't perceive as mature, because they probably won't grasp the themes running through and will just make it awkward.

That dance on the stairs came out of nowhere and is just so profoundly memorable."
1013,"'Joker' is a great film. It's very dark and unnerving but is a well made and gripping piece of work. One thing it isn't is a superhero movie, far from it. This is a story of insanity, of not belonging to the world in which Arthur lives. He seems pretty crazy from the very start but then you appreciate why he has turned out the way he has.

Joaquim Phoenix? Absolutely superb in every single scene and one of the very best performances in recent years."
1014,It's a cult movie for joker fans ......climax made me standing ovation man..you can't skip this movie at all....movie has too much depth about humans I don't tell more watch the movie please
1015,"""I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it's a comedy."" Arthur Fleck aka Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) ""Joker"" has many faces, the two most prominent are tragedy and comedy. The tragedy is played amid murders and childhood abuse. The comedy comes intermittently, mostly as an accompaniment to the tragedy. Both modes amply identify Arthur Fleck, aka Joker, as a misfit and psycho, for whom only murder can make him feel alive.

With the exception of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, no better psychological study has come by than with Joaquin Phoenix as the troubled enemy of Batman. He may win the best-acting Oscar unless a more riveting anti-hero emerges before the end of the year.

Besides Taxi Driver, another Scorsese influence shows Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a talk show host, who befriends Joker, a failed stand-up comedian. As in The King of Comedy, where De Niro's Rupert Pupkin pursues comedian Jerry Lewis, Joker ""befriends"" De Niro as talk-show host. Both films are aces at showing a character on the fringe of society, in Joker's case a nut job from neglect as an orphan, who kills Bruce Wayne's parents and his own mother.

To see Arthur, evolve into Joker is to watch a master actor take a nerdy a-social kid to a serial killer, a fitting antagonist for Bruce Wayne, who saw Arthur murder his parents.

Beyond the physical mutation of losing a Christian Bale-like fifty pounds, Phoenix consistently uses tics and laughs to emphasize how out of the center he is. The laughing condition, occurring randomly, is an apt metaphor for his inability to tell a joke or to fit normally in society. ""I just don't want to feel so bad anymore,"" Arthur whispers. It's hard to imagine he could ever feel well given he takes five different medications.

As Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger showed, the joker character holds multitudes within his persona, enough for more than two hours of any film. Todd Philips directs an origin story about a psychopathic murderer who devolves along with the society he hates: ""Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?"" Arthur

Do see one of the best performances of a male actor this year, but don't take the kids."
1018,"This movie had a lot of potential. A very suitable actor (Phoenix) for the role as looker seemed perfect, and his acting was fine! But the movie is too damn slow! The directing for this movie was just bad. Also the cliche moment of this movie were to obvious..."
1019,I'm sure lots of people worked really hard on this film. I found it slow and boring to say the least. The acting was great but the story didn't hold my attention.
1020,"I didn't know what to expect going in, but coming out I was blown away by a character study that has no right to be this good. Not a comic book fan, so maybe all this was already written, but even so - the performances, the screenplay, the music: all sums up to a film that has neither the right to be this dramatically interesting nor this entertaining."
1021,"This is without a doubt one of the best films of the decade. Truly a masterpiece on all levels.

An extremely uncomfortable look at our own sick society and the abandonment of the most vulnerable and psychologically unwell people.

Truly brilliant!!!"
1022,"Wow! Truly impressed, nothing more to say.

To Slate, Associated Press, IndieWire, TIME, and all these idiots who call themselves ""film critics"" - GFK yourselves. No wonder ""journalism"" are on decline these days, it simply don't reflect people's true opinion anymore. If it not PC garbage, it's no good to them."
1023,"'Joker' is the type of film that you want to rewatch immediately yet never watch again; it's as deeply disturbing as it is utterly compelling, leading to a unique experience that truly sticks with you. The pure visceral effect of it literally lasts for days, and once that wears off the narrative still lingers in your mind, something truly rare in today's age of cinema. It's an incredibly grounded character study, with one of the most complex protagonists in years. He's not a hero, but not quite a villain either. It's far more complicated than that, purely because it's simply far more realistic than that. Arthur fleck is just presented as a person, one who you aren't supposed to empathise with but rather pity. The film never forces you to feel a certain way about him either, as it just shows the events in a relatively unbiased way, which allows for different audience interpretations. The filmmaking here is fantastic, with everything from the cinematography and production design to the haunting score putting most films to shame. It still astounds me that Todd Phillips directed this as it's in a completely different league to anything he's helmed before. For all it's technical, behind-the-camera excellency though, there's no doubt that this wouldn't have been nowhere near as successful without Joaquin Phoenix's masterful performance. It has been said before, but it needs to be said again: this guy deserves the Oscar. It's far and away the best performance of the year, and is perhaps one of the best performances I've ever seen. Phoenix's mere presence here demands your attention and he completely throws himself headfirst into the role, outdoing himself in the process (a very high praise for an actor of his talents indeed). Sure, the writing is great too, but Phoenix completely sells Arthur's transformation in such a convincing way that I'm sure the performance could have overcame bad writing had it needed to. Thankfully though, Phoenix is matched by the film surrounding him, which just solidifies how great the whole thing is. Like I said, it's a very disturbing, even scary, watch that is completely absorbing from the opening frame. It's not fun, but it isn't supposed to be. It knows what it wants to be, establishes this very early on, and rolls with it, completely sticking the landing. It's an incredibly accomplished work and if DC stick to this route from now on, they'll soon become the leading company in comic book adaptations. 9/10"
1024,Just to spite the person below me. Reminds me a lot of taxi driver of course. Similar character arch and style of direction. Its stands alone as a great character study none the less. Joaquin phoenix's performance was definitely Oscar worthy. 10/10.
